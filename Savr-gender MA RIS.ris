AB  - We investigated the sex-related difference in characteristics and 2-year outcomes after surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) by propensity-score matching (PSM).Data from 2 prospective registries, the INSPIRIS RESILIA Durability Registry (INDURE) and IMPACT, were merged, resulting in a total of 933 patients: 735 males and 253 females undergoing first-time SAVR. The PSM was performed to assess the impact of sex on the SAVR outcomes, yielding 433 males and 243 females with comparable baseline characteristics.Females had a lower body mass index (median 27.1 vs 28.0 kg/m2; P = 0.008), fewer bicuspid valves (52% vs 59%; P = 0.036), higher EuroSCORE II (mean 2.3 vs 1.8%; P &lt; 0.001) and Society of Thoracic Surgeons score (mean 1.6 vs 0.9%; P &lt; 0.001), were more often in New York Heart Association functional class III/IV (47% vs 30%; P &lt; 0.001) and angina Canadian Cardiovascular Society III/IV (8.2% vs 4.4%; P &lt; 0.001), but had a lower rate of myocardial infarction (1.9% vs 5.2%; P = 0.028) compared to males. These differences vanished after PSM, except for the EuroSCORE II and Society of Thoracic Surgeons scores, which were still significantly higher in females. Furthermore, females required smaller valves (median diameter 23.0 vs 25.0 mm, P &lt; 0.001). There were no differences in the length of hospital stay (median 8 days) or intensive care unit stay (median 24 vs 25 hours) between the 2 sexes. At 2 years, post-SAVR outcomes were comparable between males and females, even after PSM.Despite females presenting with a significantly higher surgical risk profile, 2-year outcomes following SAVR were comparable between males and females.

AB  - Background:  Surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) is among the most commonly performed valvular surgeries. Despite many previous studies conducted in this setting, the impact of sex on outcomes in patients undergoing SAVR is still unclear. 
  Aims:  This study aimed to define sex differences in short- and long-term mortality in patients undergoing SAVR. 
  Methods:  We analyzed retrospectively all the patients undergoing isolated SAVR from January 2006 to March 2020 in the Department of Cardiovascular Surgery and Transplantology in John Paul II Hospital in Kraków. The primary endpoint was in-hospital and long-term mortality. Secondary endpoints included the duration of hospital stay and perioperative complications. Groups of men and women were compared with regard to the prosthesis type. Propensity score matching was performed to adjust for differences in baseline characteristics. 
  Results:  A total number of 4 510 patients undergoing isolated surgical SAVR were analyzed. A follow- up median (interquartile range [IQR]) was 2120 (1000–3452) days. Females made up 41.55% of the cohort and were older, displayed more non-cardiac comorbidities, and faced a higher operative risk. In both sexes, bioprostheses were more often applied (55.5% vs. 44.5%;  P &lt; 0.0001). In univariable analysis, sex was not linked to in-hospital mortality (3.7% vs. 3%;  P =  0.15) and late mortality rates (23.37% vs. 23.52 %;  P =  0.9). Upon adjustment for baseline characteristics (propensity score matching analysis) and considering 5-year survival, a long-term prognosis turned out to be better in women (86.8%) compared to men (82.7%,  P =  0.03). 
  Conclusions:  A key finding from this study suggests that female sex was not associated with higher in-hospital and late mortality rates compared to men. Further studies are needed to confirm longterm benefits in women undergoing SAVR.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study sought to examine sex-specific differences in outcomes after surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) or transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) in high-risk patients with severe aortic stenosis.
BACKGROUND: The PARTNER (Placement of Aortic Transcatheter Valve) trial demonstrated similar 2-year survival with SAVR or TAVR for high-risk patients, but sex-specific outcomes are unknown.
METHODS: In all, 699 patients (300 female) were randomly assigned 1:1 to either SAVR or TAVR with a balloon expandable pericardial tissue valve. Baseline characteristics and 2-year outcomes of TAVR versus SAVR were compared among males and females.
RESULTS: Baseline characteristics differed between the sexes. Despite higher Society of Thoracic Surgeons mortality risk scores (11.9 vs. 11.6; p = 0.05), female patients had lower prevalence of coronary artery disease (64.4% vs. 83.7%), prior coronary artery bypass graft surgery (19.8% vs. 61.2%), peripheral vascular disease (36.4% vs. 46.9%), diabetes mellitus (35.6% vs. 45.6%), and elevated creatinine (11.7% vs. 23.9%). Among female patients, procedural mortality trended lower with TAVR versus SAVR (6.8% vs. 13.1%; p = 0.07) and was maintained throughout follow-up (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.67; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.44 to 1.00; p = 0.049), driven by the transfemoral arm (HR: 0.55; 95% CI: 0.32 to 0.93; p = 0.02). Among male patients, although procedural mortality was lower with TAVR (6% vs. 12.1%; p = 0.03), there was no overall survival benefit (HR: 1.15; 95% CI: 0.82 to 1.61; p = 0.42).
CONCLUSIONS: In this retrospective subanalysis of high-risk, symptomatic aortic stenosis patients in the PARTNER trial, female subjects had lower late mortality with TAVR versus SAVR. This was especially true among patients suitable for transfemoral access and suggests that TAVR may be preferred over surgery for high-risk female patients. A randomized, controlled trial conducted specifically in female patients is necessary to properly study differences in mortality between treatment modalities.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Women are considered to have poorer prognoses after cardiac surgery, although evidence is scarce. The authors studied sex differences and long-term outcomes after surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR).
DESIGN: Nationwide retrospective cohort study.
SETTING: Six public hospitals and 2 private hospitals.
PARTICIPANTS: All first-time SAVR (±coronary artery bypass surgery) patients (excluding endocarditis) aged ≥18 with a prosthetic valve were retrospectively identified from a national registry (n = 7616). Propensity score matching identified 2814 men and 2814 women with comparable baseline features.
INTERVENTIONS: No intervention.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Outcomes were survival, major bleeding, ischemic stroke, infective endocarditis, and reoperation. Ten-year survival was 66.8% in men and 67.5% in women (hazard ratio [HR] 1.09; p = 0.107). Major bleeding occurred in 21.5% of men and 19.7% of women (HR 1.36; confidence interval [CI] 1.13-1.63; p = 0.0009) within 10 years, with similar results for mechanical and biological prosthesis. Bleeding was gastrointestinal in 38.5%, intracranial in 27.6%, and 33.9% in other sites with no sex difference in location. Ischemic stroke occurred in 12.5% of men and 13.3% of women within 10 years (HR 1.06; p = 0.614), and 4.7% of men and 2.6% of women (HR 1.77; CI 1.24-2.51; p = 0.001) had infective endocarditis, but association was present only with biological prosthesis (interaction p = 0.02). Aortic valve re-surgery was more common in men at 1 (HR 2.98; CI 1.27-7.00; p = 0.013) and 5 years after SAVR, but not at 10 years (2.4% v 3.8%; p = 0.189).
CONCLUSIONS: Baseline-matched long-term survival after SAVR is similar between sexes. Men had increased risk of bleeding, early re-surgery after SAVR, and infective endocarditis when using biological prosthesis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) is a key strategy for the treatment of aortic valve disease. However, studies have involved primarily male patients, and whether the benefits of this approach can be extrapolated to female patients is unclear.
METHODS: Clinical and administrative datasets for 12,207 patients undergoing isolated SAVR in Ontario from 2008 to 2019 were linked. Male and female patients were balanced using inverse probability treatment weighting. Mortality, endocarditis, and major hemorrhagic and thrombotic events, as well as 2 composite outcomes-major adverse cerebral and cardiovascular events (MACCE) and patient-derived adverse cardiovascular and noncardiovascular events (PACE)-and their component events, were compared in the weighted groups with a stratified log-rank test.
RESULTS: A total of 7485 male patients and 4722 female patients were included in the study. Median follow-up was 5.2 years in both sexes. All-cause mortality did not differ between sexes (hazard ratio [HR] 0.949 [95% confidence interval {CI} 0.851-1.059]). Male sex was associated with an increased risk of new-onset dialysis (HR 0.689 [95% CI 0.488-0.974]). Female sex was associated with a significantly increased risk of both new-onset heart failure (HR 1.211 [95% CI 1.051-1.394], P = 0.0081) and heart failure hospitalization (HR 1.200 [95% CI 1.036-1.390], P = 0.015). No statistically significant differences were seen in any of the other secondary outcomes between sexes.
CONCLUSIONS: This population health study demonstrated that survival did not differ between male and female patients undergoing SAVR. Significant sex-related differences were found in the risk of heart failure and new-onset dialysis, but these findings should be considered exploratory and require further study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Differences in baseline characteristics and anatomy between female and male patients with aortic valve stenosis may influence outcomes after surgical and transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). We evaluated the effect of sex on in-hospital outcomes after transfemoral (TF-TAVR), transapical (TA-TAVR), or surgical (SAVR) aortic valve replacement in a nationwide cohort.
METHODS: Baseline characteristics and outcomes from all isolated TAVR or SAVR procedures performed between 2011 and 2014 in German hospitals were analyzed (N = 64,794). Primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Unadjusted and adjusted comparisons between women and men were performed within each treatment group.
RESULTS: Females were generally older and had a higher EuroSCORE. Thus, they were preferentially treated with TF-TAVR, whereas the share of TF-TAVR and SAVR was similar in males. Females suffered more relevant bleeding after TF-TAVR and SAVR (TF-TAVR: adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.16, P = 0.018; TA-TAVR: aOR = 0.98, P = 0.799; SAVR: aOR = 1.12, P = 0.005). However, prolonged postoperative ventilation was less frequently necessary in females (aOR TF-TAVR: 0.69, P < 0.001; TA-TAVR: 0.69, P < 0.001; SAVR: 0.76, P < 0.001) and stroke risk was lower (TA-TAVR: aOR = 0.60, P = 0.001; TF-TAVR: aOR = 0.74, P = 0.001; SAVR: aOR = 0.61, P < 0.001). In-hospital mortality was slightly decreased in females undergoing TF-TAVR after adjustment (aOR = 0.87, P = 0.047), and equal in TA-TAVR (aOR = 0.96, P = 0.640) or SAVR (aOR = 1.02, P = 0.807).
CONCLUSIONS: This nation-wide analysis of sex-specific outcomes after aortic-valve replacement procedures showed that women are higher-risk for bleeding, but lower-risk for stroke, mechanical ventilation, and TF-TAVR mortality. Understanding these differences and their basis may help improve outcomes.

AB  - Gender disparities in short- and long-term outcomes have been documented in cardiac and valvular heart surgery. However, there is a paucity of data regarding these differences in the bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) population. The aim of this study was to examine gender-specific differences in short- and long-term outcomes after surgical aortic valve (AV) replacement in patients with BAV. A retrospective analysis was performed in 628 consecutive patients with BAV who underwent AV surgery from April 2004 to December 2013. To reduce bias when comparing outcomes by gender, propensity score matching obtained on the basis of potential confounders was used. Women with BAV who underwent AV surgery presented with more advanced age (mean 60.7 ± 13.8 vs 56.3 ± 13.6 years, p <0.001) and less aortic regurgitation (29% vs 44%, p <0.001) and had a higher risk for in-hospital mortality (mean Ambler score 3.4 ± 4.4 vs 2.5 ± 4.0, p = 0.015). After propensity score matching, women received more blood products postoperatively (48% vs 34%, p = 0.028) and had more prolonged postoperative lengths of stay (median 5 days [interquartile range 5 to 7] vs 5 days [interquartile range 4 to 6], p = 0.027). Operative, discharge, and 30-day mortality and overall survival were not significantly different. In conclusion, women with BAV who underwent AV surgery were older, presented with less aortic regurgitation, and had increased co-morbidities, lending higher operative risk. Although women received more blood products and had significantly longer lengths of stay, short- and long-term outcomes were similar.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Studies assessing the differential impact of sex on outcomes of aortic valve replacement (AVR) yielded conflicting results. We sought to investigate sex-related differences in AVR utilization, patient risk profile, and in-hospital outcomes using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample.
METHODS AND RESULTS: In total, 166 809 patients (63% male and 37% female) who underwent AVR between 2003 and 2014 were identified, and 48.5% had a concomitant cardiac surgery procedure. Compared with men, women were older and had more nonatherosclerotic comorbid conditions including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, obstructive pulmonary disease, atrial fibrillation/flutter, and anemia but fewer incidences of coronary and peripheral arterial disease and prior sternotomies. In-hospital mortality was significantly higher in women (5.6% versus 4%, P<0.001). Propensity matching was performed to assess the impact of sex on the outcomes of isolated AVR and yielded 28 237 matched pairs of male and female participants. In the propensity-matched groups, in-hospital mortality was higher in women (3.3% versus 2.9%, P<0.001). Along with vascular complications and blood transfusion (6% versus 5.6%, P=0.027 and 40.4% versus 33.9%, P<0.001, respectively). Rates of stroke, permanent pacemaker implantation, and acute kidney injury requiring dialysis were similar (2.4% versus 2.4%, P=0.99; 6% versus 6.3%, P=0.15; and 1.4% versus 1.3%, P=0.14, respectively). Length of stay median and interquartile range were both similar between groups (7±6 days). Rates of nonhome discharge were higher among women (27.9% versus 19.6%, P<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Women have worse in-hospital mortality following AVR compared with men. Coupled with the accumulating evidence suggesting higher magnitude of benefit of transcatheter AVR over AVR in women, women should perhaps be offered transcatheter AVR over AVR at a lower threshold than men.

AB  - Objective: To compare the long-term outcomes in women and men after valve replacement surgery.
Design: Observational study.
Setting: Postoperative aortic valve replacement (AVR) or mitral valve replacement (MVR).
Patients: 3118 patients (1261 women, 1857 men) who underwent AVR or MVR between 1976 and 2006 (2255 AVR, 863 MVR), with mean follow-up of 5.6 (4.5) years.
Main outcome measures: The independent effect of gender on the risk of long-term complications (reoperation, stroke and death) after valve replacement surgery using multivariate actuarial methods.
Results: After implantation of an aortic valve bioprosthesis, women had a significantly lower rate of reoperation compared to men (comorbidity-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 0.4; 95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.2 to 0.9). In contrast, if an aortic mechanical prosthesis had been implanted, women were more at risk for late stroke compared to men (HR 1.7; CI 1.1 to 2.7). After adjustment for age and co-morbidities, women had significantly better long-term survival compared to men after bioprosthetic AVR (HR 0.5; CI 0.3 to 0.6), but there was no survival difference between genders after mechanical AVR. Trends existed towards better survival for women after bioprosthetic MVR (HR 0.6; CI 0.4 to 1.0) and mechanical MVR (HR 0.8; CI 0.5 to 1.1).
Conclusion: The long-term outcomes after valve replacement surgery differ between women and men. Although women have more late strokes after valve replacement, they undergo fewer reoperations and have better overall long-term survival compared to men.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite the well‐known impact of female sex on outcome after surgical aortic valve replacement (sAVR), few studies investigated its role after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). METHODS: After propensity‐matching for age, baseline comorbidities, previous interventions, priority, frailty score, New York Heart Association class, left ventricular function and associated cardiac diseases, hospital mortality, and procedure‐related morbidities of 388 women (194 TAVR versus 194 sAVR)‐of 5,231 patients enrolled in 70 centers participating in this prospective multicenter national registry‐were analyzed at a central management unit of the Italian National Institute of Health. RESULTS: Although hospital mortality was comparable (4.1% TAVR versus 3.1% sAVR; p = 0.177), women undergoing sAVR showed a higher rate of transfusion (63.9% versus 37.1% TAVR; p = 0.0001); higher number of transfusions per patient (3.6 ± 0.4 versus 2.3 ± 0.3 TAVR; p = 0.049); a higher incidence of low cardiac output state (5.7% versus 3.6% TAVR; p = 0.017) and acute renal failure (8.8% versus 4.1% TAVR; p = 0.01); and higher mean transprosthetic gradients (15.7 ± 12.6 mm Hg versus 11.9 ± 10.7 mm Hg TAVR; p = 0.004). In contrast, women undergoing TAVR experienced significant postprocedural aortic regurgitation (mild, 37.6% versus 7.7% sAVR; moderate‐to‐severe, 7.1% versus 1.5% sAVR; p = 0.0001) and a higher rate of stroke (7.7% versus 2.5% sAVR; p = 0.037), major vascular complications (9.3% versus 0.5% sAVR; p = 0.0001), pacemaker implantation (12.4% versus 6.2% sAVR; p = 0.004), need for emergent percutaneous coronary intervention (1.0% versus 0% sAVR; p = 0.007), and longer intermediate care unit length of stay (2.5 ± 4.4 days versus 1.4 ± 2.6 days sAVR; p = 0.008). Perioperative myocardial infarction and lengths of intensive care unit stay and hospitalization were comparable (not significant). CONCLUSIONS: Women undergoing sAVR and TAVR experienced different periprocedural morbidities. These data strongly suggest the need to strictly individualize the indications.

TI  - Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement: focus on Sex-Related Differences in Outcomes
AU  - Flaherty, MP

T2  - American journal of cardiovascular drugs
AB  - Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has transformed the management of severe aortic stenosis for high‐risk and inoperable patients. The 10‐year experience in Europe has proven the technology to be safe and effective in select populations. The PARTNER trial, the first prospective, randomized, controlled trial for TAVR, showed the technology to be superior to medical management for inoperable patients and equivalent to surgical aortic valve replacement for high‐risk patients. Research in cardiovascular medicine has been dominated by studies on the male sex, due to the incidence of the disease process and partly due to historic predominance of male subjects in research studies. Alternatively, TAVR studies focused on high‐risk and inoperable patients who are equally distributed by sex. Although sex‐related differences are apparent in their baseline characteristics, outcomes have been mixed, with evidence suggesting that female patients may have a mortality advantage with TAVR. Herein we review the TAVR procedure and devices currently available and focus our discussion on outcomes after transcatheter or surgical aortic valve replacement in patients with severe aortic stenosis.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study sought to examine the impact of tricuspid regurgitation (TR) on mortality in patients with low‐flow, low‐gradient (LF‐LG) aortic stenosis (AS) and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). BACKGROUND: TR is often observed in patients with LF‐LG AS and low LVEF, but its impact on prognosis remains unknown. METHODS: A total of 211 patients (73±10 years of age; 77% men) with LF‐LG AS (mean gradient<40 mm Hg and indexed aortic valve area [AVA]≤0.6 cm2/m2) and reduced LVEF (≤40%) were prospectively enrolled in the TOPAS (True or Pseudo‐Severe Aortic Stenosis) study and 125 (59%) of them underwent aortic valve replacement (AVR) within 3 months following inclusion. The severity of AS was assessed by the projected AVA (AVAproj) at normal flow rate (250 ml/s), as previously described and validated. The severity of TR was graded according to current guidelines. RESULTS: Among the 211 patients included in the study, 22 (10%) had no TR, 113 (54%) had mild (grade 1), 50 (24%) mild‐to‐moderate (grade 2), and 26 (12%) moderate‐to‐severe (grade 3) or severe (grade 4) TR. During a mean follow‐up of 2.4±2.2 years, 104 patients (49%) died. Univariable analysis showed that TR≥2 was associated with increased risk of all‐cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.82, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.22 to 2.71; p=0.004) and cardiovascular mortality (HR: 1.85, 95% CI: 1.20 to 2.83; p=0.005). After adjustment for age, sex, coronary artery disease, AVAproj, LVEF, stroke volume index, right ventricular dysfunction, mitral regurgitation, and type of treatment (AVR vs. conservative), the presence of TR≥2 was an independent predictor of all‐cause mortality (HR: 1.88, 95% CI: 1.08 to 3.23; p=0.02) and cardiovascular mortality (HR: 1.92, 95% CI: 1.05 to 3.51; p=0.03). Furthermore, in patients undergoing AVR, TR≥3 was an independent predictor of 30‐day mortality compared with TR=0/1 (odds ratio [OR]: 7.24, 95% CI: 1.56 to 38.2; p=0.01) and TR=2 (OR: 4.70, 95% CI: 1.00 to 25.90; p=0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with LF‐LG AS and reduced LVEF, TR is independently associated with increased risk of cumulative all‐cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality regardless of the type of treatment. In patients undergoing AVR, moderate/severe TR is associated with increased 30‐day mortality. Further studies are needed to determine whether TR is a risk marker or a risk factor of mortality and whether concomitant surgical correction of TR at the time of AVR might improve outcomes for this high‐risk population.

AB  - Objectives: The objective of the study is to evaluate the performance of high‐dimensional propensity scores (hdPSs) for controlling indication bias as compared with propensity scores (PSs) in surgical comparative effectiveness studies. Study Design and Setting: Patients who underwent interventional transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) or surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) between 2013 and 2017 were included from the French nationwide hospitals. At each hospital level, matched pairs of patients who underwent TAVI and SAVR were formed using PSs, considering 20 patient baseline characteristics, and hdPSs, considering the same patient characteristics and 300 additional variables from procedure and diagnosis codes the year before surgery. We compared death, reoperation, and stroke up to 3 years between TAVI and SAVR using Cox or Fine and Gray models. Results: Before matching, 12 of 20 patient characteristics were imbalanced between the included patients who underwent TAVI and SAVR. No significant imbalance persisted after matching with both methods. Hazard ratio of 1‐year death, reoperation, and stroke was 1.3 [1.1; 1.4], 1.6 [1.1; 2.4], and 1.4 [1.2; 1.7] for TAVI relative to SAVR with PSs (n = 9,498 pairs) and 1.1 [1.0; 1.3], 1.3 [0.8; 2.0], and 1.3 [1.0; 1.6] with hdPSs (n = 7,157). Conclusion: HdPS estimations were more consistent with results seen in randomized controlled trials. The HdPS is a promising alternative for the PS to control indication bias in comparative studies of surgical procedures.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to compare gender‐related differences in outcomes of patients undergoing TAVI over a long‐term follow‐up period. BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has been considered the standard therapy for patients with inoperable or high‐risk symptomatic aortic stenosis. The influence of gender‐related differences in outcomes of patients undergoing TAVI is currently on debate. METHODS: From January 2008 to January 2015, 819 patients (49% men) underwent TAVI and were included in a multicenter Brazilian registry. Patients were followed‐up and clinical outcomes were evaluated according to the updated Valve Academic Research Consortium‐2 criteria. RESULTS: Mean follow‐up was 497 ± 478 days. Compared with women, men had a lower rate of major or life‐threatening bleeding (12.0% vs. 20.6%; HR = 0.57 [95CI% 0.40‐0.81]; P = 0.001), and major vascular complications (6% vs. 11.7%; HR = 0.50 [95CI% 0.31‐0.82]; P = 0.004). At 30 days, all‐cause mortality was lower in men than in women (6.5% vs. 11.5%; P = 0.013), however, cumulative all‐cause mortality was similar between groups (25.9% vs. 29.7%, men and women, respectively, HR = 0.92 [95CI% 0.71‐1.19]; P = 0.52) over the entire follow‐up period. By adjusted Cox regression model, renal function, diabetes, peripheral artery disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) remained independently predictors of all‐cause mortality. CONCLUSIONS: In this large‐scale study evaluating patients undergoing TAVI, 30‐day mortality was higher among women than men driven by significant higher rates of major or life‐threatening bleeding and major vascular complications. However, all‐cause mortality on long‐term follow‐up was similar between groups. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - This study applies L‐wave measurements of mid‐diastolic trans‐mitral flow. Although considered to be a marker of elevated filling pressure or delayed myocardial relaxation, its clinical and prognostic value is yet to be completely elucidated. It has been shown that transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) induces reverse remodeling and improves diastolic function and prognosis in patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS). Our purpose was to evaluate the prognostic value of L‐wave following TAVR. We examined clinical and echocardiographic data of patients undergoing TAVR. L‐Wave presence and velocity were recorded at baseline and at 1 month and 6 months following TAVR. The effect of the procedure on L‐wave measurements and its impact on mortality and other clinical outcomes were analyzed. A total of 502 patients (mean age 82.58 ± 5.9) undergoing TAVR were included. Patients with baseline L‐wave (n = 68, 12%) had a smaller stroke volume index by 5.7 ± 2.3 ml/m2 (p = 0.01) as compared to patients without L‐wave at baseline. L‐waves disappeared In 35% and 70% of patients at 1 month and at 6 months respectively. Baseline L‐wave velocity was 34.8 ± 11.5 (cm/s) and decreased significantly at follow‐up examinations. Patients with persistent L‐wave following TAVR had higher 3‐year adjusted mortality rates (HR 5.7, 95% CI 3.7–8.9, p < 0.001). Multivariate analysis of survival was also statistically significant (p < 0.001). TAVR induces L‐wave disappearance and a decrease in L‐wave velocity in patients with severe AS. L‐wave persistence following TAVR is an independent risk factor for mortality.

AB  - Background: Women comprise almost 50% of patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and previous studies have indicated higher rates of procedural complications and bleeding in women compared to men. It is unknown whether men and women demonstrate a differential response to bivalirudin versus unfractionated heparin (UFH) in TAVR. We sought to evaluate outcomes by sex and type of anticoagulant from the Bivalirudin Versus Heparin Anticoagulation in Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (BRAVO‐3) trial of transfemoral TAVR. Methods: BRAVO‐3 was a randomized multicenter trial comparing transfemoral TAVR with bivalirudin versus UFH (31 centers, n = 802). The primary endpoint was 48 h major bleeding defined as Bleeding Academic Research Consortium (BARC) type ≥3b. Major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) were a composite of 30‐day death, myocardial infarction, or stroke. Net adverse cardiovascular events (NACE) were a composite of BARC ≥3b bleeding or 30‐day MACE. We examined the outcomes in men and women. Results: The total cohort included 49% women (n = 391, 195 received bivalirudin and 196 UFH) and 51% men (n = 411, 209 received bivalirudin and 202 UFH). Women were older than men with fewer comorbidities including coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, diabetes but similar EuroSCORE I. Women received smaller sheath and device sizes compared with men without differences in the use of vascular closure devices. At 48‐hr post‐TAVR there was no difference in bleeding or vascular complications in women compared to men. The use of bivalirudin did not result in significantly lower bleeding at 48 hr or 30‐days compared to UFH. Conclusions: There was no difference in early outcomes with bivalirudin versus UFH in men or women undergoing contemporary TAVR. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Women with severe aortic valve stenosis (AS) have better LV systolic function and more concentric LV geometry than their male counterparts. However, sex differences in cardiovascular (CV) outcome during progression of AS have not been reported from a longitudinal prospective study. METHODS: Doppler echocardiography and CV events were recorded during a median of 4.0 years in 979 men and 632 women aged 28‐86 (mean 67±10) years in the Simvastatin Ezetimibe in Aortic Stenosis (SEAS) study. LV systolic function was assessed by EF and midwall shortening (MWS). Study outcomes were AS‐related events, ischaemic CV events and total mortality. RESULTS: The annular cumulative incidence of AS events, ischaemic CV events and death was 8.1%, 3.4% and 2.8% in women, and 8.9%, 4.4% and 2.4% in men, respectively. Women and men had similar AS progression rate whether measured by peak jet velocity, mean gradient or valve area. In multivariate analyses, female sex independently predicted less reduction in LV MWS and EF during follow‐up (both p<0.05). In time‐varying Cox analyses, women had a 40% lower rate of ischaemic CV events (95% CI 21% to 54%), in particular, more than 50% lower rate of stroke and coronary artery bypass grafting, and a 31% lower all‐cause mortality (95% CI 1% to 51%), independent of active study treatment, age and hypertension, as well as time‐varying valve area, low systolic function and abnormal LV geometry. AS event rate did not differ by sex. CONCLUSIONS: In the SEAS study, women and men had similar rates of AS progression and AS‐related events. However, women had lower total mortality and ischaemic CV event rate than men independent of confounders. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00092677.

AB  - Background: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is an effective therapeutic method for elderly high‐risk patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis, not eligible for surgical treatment. Aim: The aim of the study was to evaluate short‐term changes in elderly people's quality of life following TAVI, based on the POL‐TAVI registry. Methods: One hundred and eighty‐four octogenarians' and nonagenarians' samples from the POL‐TAVI database were included in the study. The quality of life status was assessed with EQ‐5D‐3L questionnaire at baseline and after one‐month follow‐up. Results: The mean of patients' age was 84 (80‐93) years. Logistic EuroSCORE mean was 19.83% (3.48‐83.94%), and transaortic mean gradient was 54.99 (19.0‐149.0) mm Hg. At baseline, up to 24.50% of patients declared severe problems in performing usual activities. 13.60% felt extreme pain or discomfort; 9.80% were unable to wash and dress by themselves; 8.20% were extremely anxious or depressed; and 7.10% of the patients in the study were confined to bed. After 30 days the percentage of patients declaring severe problems in each dimension did not exceed 4.00%. The comparison between quality of life data at baseline and after one‐month follow‐up showed a significant improvement in each of five dimensions: mobility, self‐care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression (p < 0.001). Patients' quality of life was increasing regardless of gender (female vs. male), the type of anaesthesia (general vs. local), and the type of procedure (TA vs. TF). Conclusions: Short‐term quality of life in the elderly subjects was significantly improved after one‐month follow‐up following TAVI.

T2  - Journal of heart valve disease
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM OF THE STUDY: The study aim was to monitor serum troponin and plasma lactate concentrations in conventional aortic valve replacement compared to a beating‐heart technique, perfused via the coronary sinus. METHODS: In this prospective, non‐randomized study, which was conducted between 2003 and 2009, a total of 35 patients was allocated to two groups, based on the method of myocardial protection. The groups did not differ significantly in terms of preoperative parameters. Levels of lactate were measured in all 35 patients, and of troponin I in 20 patients, in consecutive samples during and after surgery. RESULTS: There was no in‐hospital mortality and no serious complications among patients. The cardiopulmonary bypass and aortic cross‐clamp times were each significantly shorter and lactate and troponin I concentrations higher, in the beating‐heart group. No perioperative myocardial infarction was observed. CONCLUSION: Although good clinical results were observed in patients operated when using the beating‐heart technique with retrograde coronary sinus perfusion, postoperative serum levels of troponin I were higher than in patients operated on using a conventional technique. Although troponin I is considered a prognostic factor for postoperative mortality, this parameter applies only to selected patients rather than for widespread use.

AB  - It is unknown whether edoxaban versus dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) has differential treatment effects on leaflet thrombosis, cerebral thromboembolism, and neurologic or neurocognitive dysfunction according to clinical and anatomic factors after transcatheter aortic valve implantation. To investigate the relative effects of edoxaban and DAPT on leaflet and cerebral thromboembolism in patients with major risk factors. The primary end point of this study was the incidence of leaflet thrombosis on computed tomography at 6 months. The secondary end points were new cerebral lesions on brain magnetic resonance imaging and neurologic and neurocognitive dysfunction between baseline and 6‐month follow‐up. Cox regression models assessed the consistency of the treatment effects in the prespecified subgroups. The favorable effect of edoxaban versus DAPT on the leaflet thrombosis was consistent across multiple clinical or anatomic subgroups, without significant interaction between the drug effect and each subgroup (p for interaction for age = 0.597, gender = 0.557, body mass index = 0.866, Society of Thoracic Surgeons score = 0.307, valve type = 0.702, edoxaban reduction criteria = 0.604, and valve morphology = 0.688). However, the incidence of new cerebral lesions on brain magnetic resonance imaging and worsening of neurologic and neurocognitive function were not significantly different between the groups among the various key subgroups. The relative effects of edoxaban and DAPT on the risk of leaflet thrombosis, cerebral thromboembolism, and neurologic dysfunction were consistent across a diverse spectrum of clinical or anatomical factors. Further studies are required to define tailored antithrombotic therapy for high‐risk groups with specific clinical or anatomic characteristics.

AB  - Background: Stroke and bleeding are frequent complications after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Previous studies have shown a higher incidence of bleeding and stroke in women. However, the net balance of these 2 outcomes and the role of antithrombotic management has not been studied before. The aim of our study was to compare bleeding and ischemic complications after TAVR between men and women stratified by antiplatelet and oral anticoagulant (OAC) regimen. Methods: The POPular TAVI Trial was a randomized controlled trial to test the hypothesis that monotherapy with aspirin or OAC after TAVR is safer than the addition of clopidogrel. The 2 primary endpoints of our subanalysis were: 1) all bleedings; and 2) a composite of stroke and myocardial infarction. The secondary endpoints were: 1) nonprocedural bleeding; 2) major or life‐threatening bleedings; 3) stroke; 4) myocardial infarction; and 5) death. Results: A total of 665 patients were included in the aspirin cohort (A) and 313 patients in the OAC cohort (B). In cohort A, 323 (48.6%) were female; 142 (45.4%) were female in cohort B. After 1 year, 106 (22.8%) bleedings had occurred in women vs 121 (23.6%) in men (P = 0.815), and 26 (5.6%) ischemic events occurred in women vs 36 (7.0%) in men (P = 0.429). However, major or life‐threatening bleeding had occurred in 58 women (12.5%) vs in 38 (7.4%) men (P = 0.011). This difference was mainly driven by a higher rate of major or life‐threatening bleeding in women in the aspirin monotherapy group of cohort A (38 events in women [11.8%] vs 17 events in men [5.0%]; P = 0.002). Conclusion: There were no statistically significant differences in the rate of bleeding and stroke risk between men and women after TAVR. However, the risk of major life‐threatening bleeding after TAVR was higher in women compared with men, and was mainly driven by the higher risk of major or life‐threatening bleeding in women than men on aspirin monotherapy.

TI  - Effectiveness of Inspiratory Muscle Training for People with Ischemic Heart Disease Revascularized by Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty
AU  - NCT06681740
T2  - https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT06681740
AB  - Myocardial ischemia According to the Spanish Heart Foundation, myocardial ischemia (MI)is the disease caused by atherosclerosis of the coronary arteries, responsible forproviding blood to the heart muscle. Coronary atherosclerosis is a slow process ofcollagen formation and accumulation of lipids (fats) and inflammatory cells (lymphocytes)that causes narrowing of the lumen of the coronary arteries. This process begins in thefirst decades of life, but does not present symptoms until the stenosis of the coronaryartery becomes so severe that it causes an imbalance between the supply of oxygen to themyocardium and its metabolic needs3. In this case, myocardial ischemia occurs, which maybe chronic, known as chronic coronary syndrome or stable angina pectoris, or suddenocclusion due to thrombosis of the artery, which causes a lack of oxygenation of themyocardium that gives rise to coronary syndrome. Acute also called unstable angina andacute myocardial infarction. MI reduces force production, causes arrhythmias, and causesmuscle damage, leading to acute ischemic contractile failure of the heart. Patients withchronic ischemic heart disease have lower evaluations of their social life and theircoping with daily routine.The consequence of the processes described above is that people who suffer from MIdecrease their tolerance to exercise, functionality and performance in activities ofdaily living, which leads them to sedentary behaviors, worsening their quality of life.Furthermore, a vicious circle of inactivity and clinical and functional deterioration isestablished that produces a general worsening of physical condition and atrophy ofperipheral and respiratory muscles. All of these circumstances lead to a decrease infunctional capacity and therefore to a worse prognosis of the disease.Regarding the risk factors that lead to the development of MI, there is a combination ofsocioeconomic, metabolic, behavioral and environmental risk factors. Among them areadvanced age, high blood pressure, an unhealthy diet, high cholesterol, diabetes,obesity, smoking, a sedentary lifestyle, stress, family history and harmful consumptionof toxins, among others. Most of these factors are modifiable and it is one of thefundamental pillars of their treatment to get affected people to change their lifestyle.The incidence is higher in men since women benefit from a hormonal protective effectduring their fertile life. This circumstance disappears with menopause, which equalizesthe cases in both sexes from 45‐50 years of age.Epidemiology It is estimated that in 2020 there were 244.1 million people living with MIworldwide. Of them, 141 million were men and 103.1 million were women. The regions ofNorth Africa, the Middle East, Central Asia, South Asia and Eastern Europe had thehighest prevalence rates. The global mortality rate was 112.37 per 100,000, this beingalso higher in the regions with the highest prevalence.MI affects approximately 126 million people worldwide, representing 1.72% of the world'spopulation. It is the main cause of death, with 9 million deaths annually. The incidencebegins to increase in the fourth decade of life and is higher in men than in women. Indeveloped countries, about a third of all deaths in people over 35 years of age areattributed to this disease. In the United States, it is estimated that almost half of menand approximately one‐third of women will experience some symptoms of MI during theirlifetime. In the European Union, cardiovascular diseases account for 40% of all deaths.Furthermore, the economic costs associated with MI are significant. The treatment ofcardiovascular diseases constitutes 54% of total health expenditure, and contributesapproximately a quarter of productivity losses.Coronary heart disease is closely related to aging. Therefore, despite the decrease inits incidence observed in recent decades, all indicators suggest that its incidence willincrease in the years to come. Coronary syndromes are expected to increase between 69%and 119% by 2049, mainly due to the growth of the population of patients over 75 years ofage. For the group of patients between 25 and 75 years of age, the incidence is projectedto remain stable in the coming decades.TreatmentIt usually consists of thrombolysis (revascularization of the artery or arteries whoseflow is compromised) and can be done in two ways: ‐ By open surgery performing a bridge between two vessels that redirects blood to theaffected myocardium. ‐ By performing a percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). This optionis less invasive and uses a balloon at the tip of a thin tube, called a catheter, towiden the artery. A small spring is usually placed to keep the artery open.Secondary prevention Once the first cardiovascular event has occurred, it is important toprevent it from happening again. This is called secondary prevention. In this regard, thenon‐pharmacological strategy with the most evidence at present to reduce mortality,cardiovascular disability, improve the quality of life of patients and prevent furthercardiovascular events is cardiac rehabilitation programs (CRP). Moreover, theircost‐effectiveness is well known. These include smoking cessation, control of othercardiovascular risk factors, health education, psychological therapy, and a multimodalexercise program (cardiovascular and strength training). Usually 2‐3 training sessionsare performed weekly for 8‐10 weeks.Inspiratory muscle training Specific inspiratory muscle training (IMT) consists ofapplying higher than usual workloads to the muscles responsible for generating thenecessary negative pressure inside the thorax for air to enter the lungs. This overloadinduces adaptations that produce an increase in the strength of this musculature. It iswidely used as part of the treatment of people with chronic respiratory diseases andpeople with heart failure (HF). It is a very safe intervention that reduces dyspnea andimproves functional capacity and quality of life in these patients.Overload is achieved by breathing in through specific devices containing a valve whosethreshold can be regulated. In order to decide the pressure at which each individual willtrain, his or her Maximum Inspiratory Pressure (MIP) must be measured beforehand.Training protocols at high loads, between 50% and 80% of the MIP, are those that obtainthe best results according to the available evidence for patients with HF and forpatients revascularized with grafting by open surgery. Therefore, the intervention willbe performed with loads of 70% of the MIP value, completing 3 sets of 10 repetitions, 4days a week, with 3 minutes rest between sets, during the 8 weeks of the CRP.Hypothesis and ObjectivesJustification In view of the perspective presented above and the available literature, itis pertinent to conduct a low‐risk randomized clinical trial evaluating the effectivenessof the addition of IMT to a CRP of people with IC with PTCA. A recently published review9concludes that the quality of the evidence for inspiratory muscle training for theimprovement of maximal oxygen consumption and expiratory muscle strength in thispopulation is very low. However, it should be taken into account that most of theclinical trials carried out to date have been performed on patients who underwent opensurgery, so that the literature is scarce in percutaneously operated patients. In thissense, the results of our study will be specifically focused on percutaneouslyrevascularized patients, thereby increasing knowledge of the effects of this interventionin the subgroup of patients with IHD and PTCA on these and other variables. Although CRPhave been shown to be effective there is limited evidence on the addition of an IMT inpatients with IHD. Clinical practice guidelines do not routinely recommend IMT due tothis lack of evidence, so we aim to shed light on its effectiveness.Hypotheses The addition of inspiratory muscle training to a cardiac rehabilitationprogram for people with percutaneously revascularized ischemic heart disease will lead tobetter results in terms of functional capacity and muscle strength, in addition to socialsupport, anxiety, depression, coping with the disease, sexual dysfunction, quality oflife, quality of sleep, eating habits and body composition, after 16 sessions ofintervention compared to the control group.H2.‐ It is expected that a large proportion of the participants will present anxiety anddepression, poor coping with the disease and poor control of cardiovascular risk factors.H3.‐ There will be greater effects of the intervention on the variables in the subgroupof women, due to their greater degree of commitment to the intervention program.ObjectivesI. General objective ‐ To analyze the effectiveness of the addition of inspiratory muscle training to acardiac rehabilitation program in people with percutaneously revascularized ischemicheart disease after 16 sessions of intervention, based on functional capacity, inaddition to muscle strength, social support, anxiety, depression, coping with thedisease, sexual dysfunction, quality of life, sleep quality, eating habits and bodycomposition.II. Secondary objectives ‐ To know the biopsychosocial profile of this population based on functional capacity,in addition to muscular strength, social support, anxiety, depression, coping withthe disease, sexual dysfunction, quality of life, quality of sleep, eating habitsand body composition. ‐ To analyze gender differences through subgroup analysis. MethodologyThe present clinical trial has been previously approved by the Provincial Research EthicsCommittee of Malaga with Code SICEIA‐2024‐001869 in its session number 9, held on09/26/2024.The characteristics of the proposed clinical trial are reported in accordance with theSPIRIT standards (Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials).Study design Randomized, controlled (parallel), triple‐blind, low‐risk clinical trial.Study Setting The study will be carried out at the Cardiac Rehabilitation Unit (CRU) ofthe Hospital Universitario Virgen de la Victoria de Málaga (HUVV).Study Subjects Persons with Myocardial Ischemia (MI) referred to the CRU of the HUVV whohave undergone PTCA.Inclusion criteria: i) people with MI with PTCA; ii) both sexes; iii) over 18 years ofage; iv) under 80 years of age; v) absence of cognitive deficit and/or physicallimitations that would prevent them from performing physical exercise or completing thequestionnaires necessary for participation in the study.Exclusion criteria: i) Disease or condition that contraindicates exercise such as severehypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, severe aortic stenosis and/or dissecting aorticaneurysm; ii) Patients who refuse treatment or do not sign the informed consent.Sampling, Sample Size and Randomization Consecutive sampling will be carried out withpatients attending the HUVV CRU and meeting the criteria described above.The sample size was calculated to detect differences between groups in our main variable,functional capacity measured by maximal oxygen consumption. According to themeta‐analysis by Fabero‐Garrido et al , people with ischemic heart disease who haveundergone an inspiratory muscle training program have a mean difference of 2.18 mlO2/kg/min with respect to the control group and we want to find a deviation of 1 MET (3.5ml O2/kg/min). The calculations were carried out with the statistical software G*Power3.1, considering in all cases a confidence level of 95% and a power of 80%.In view of the above, a sample size of 33 subjects per group (66 in total) wasestablished. In addition, to minimize the impact of possible dropouts, the total samplewas increased by 10% to 72 patients, which will lead to the final inclusion of 36patients in each group.Randomization of participants will be performed through a computer program that generatesa sequence of random numbers.Cardiac Rehabilitation Program.The usual CRP will be carried out and supervised by the usual multidisciplinary team ofthe HUVV. It is composed of a cardiologist, a rehabilitation physician, aphysiotherapist, a nurse and a psychologist. Prior to inclusion in the study, eachparticipant will undergo a simple ergometry test to determine their maximum heart rate(MHR), observe their behavior at maximum effort and rule out conditions thatcontraindicate exercise. The study subjects will attend the cardiac rehabilitation roomof the hospital 3 days a week. Two of these days will be dedicated to physical exercisesessions and the third to health education and a group psychological therapy session.The health education session will deal with a different topic each week (basic knowledgeof their pathology, proper medication, safe physical exercise, sexual dysfunction,healthy eating and control of cardiovascular risk factors).On the other hand, those subjects suffering from erectile dysfunction will be offered thepossibility of being seen in the urology office. The rehabilitation physician willperform a nutritional assessment by bioimpedanciometry and a morphological assessment ofthe quadriceps and another of abdominal fat, both by ultrasound. Participants with poorlycontrolled diabetes and/or morbid obesity will see the endocrinologist of the cardiacrehabilitation team.The training sessions will last approximately 75 minutes. The structure will be asfollows: ‐ Reception of patients, taking of constants (blood pressure, heart rate and glycemiain case of diabetic patients) and placement of telemetry. ‐ Warm up ‐ Strength Exercise: It will consist of different exercises with dumbbells and elasticbands involving various joints. We will work at 50% of 1 repetition maximum (1RM)measured indirectly with the method of 20 repetitions maximum (20RM). Three sets of10 repetitions of the following exercises will be completed: elbow flexion, shoulderabduction and knee extension. The rest interval between sets will be 30 seconds. ‐ Cardiovascular Exercise: It will be performed on a treadmill or stationary bicycle.It will have a duration of 30 minutes. The first month the patient will be trainedat 70% of the heart rate resulting from applying the Karvonen formula and the secondmonth at 80%. The modality may be continuous or intervallic depending on thepatient's tolerance. ‐ Relaxation and return to calm: patients will remain seated in chairs for 5 minutesduring which a guided relaxation audio will be played. ‐ Checking of constants and farewell.Patients will be weighed every week to monitor their evolution and rule out possibleadverse effects of the training. The program will be extended for 8 weeks untilcompleting 16 concurrent training sessions. At the end of the program, ergometry, bloodanalysis and the rest of the tests will be repeated.MaskingNone of the participants will know to which group they belong since they will all begiven the same EEMI device. For the control group a load of 5 cmH2O will be set. Thiswork intensity is below that necessary to achieve adaptations in the inspiratory musclesand will therefore function as a placebo.The evaluators will also not know to which group the study subjects belong since theywill not participate in the assignment or intervention process.The analysis will be done independently since the data will be delivered coded.Statistical analysisMeasures of central tendency and dispersion will be used for numerical variables, as wellas relative frequencies for categorical variables to assess comparability between groups.All relevant variables will be examined for this purpose.Exploratory data analysis will be performed to identify and address outliers that mayaffect the results. Appropriate corrections will be applied to mitigate their influence.To contrast the differences between the control and experimental groups, the Student'st‐test for independent samples or the nonparametric Mann‐Whitney test will be usedaccording to the normality of the data, measured with the Kolmogorov‐Smirnov test. Forpre‐ and post‐intervention comparisons, Student's t test for paired samples will be usedin case of normality or the Wilcoxon test, otherwise. In the case of qualitativevariables, chi‐square test will be used.In addition to the aforementioned statistical analyses, possible complex and nonlinearrelationships between variables will be explored by means of regression models ormultivariate analyses, such as multiple regression or principal component analysis.The analyses will be performed with the IBM SPSS v.24 statistical program. Anticipatedrisks and contingency plansAnticipated risk Contingency plan:Non‐compliance of participants with the IMT Submission of paper log of compliance in theform of a diaryIncorrect performance of the IMT technique Weekly reinforcement session at HUVVDoubts about the performance of the IMT by the participants The physiotherapistsupervising the CRP physical exercise will always be available during the sessions toclarify any doubts.Prospective It would be interesting to study in future clinical trials the specifictraining of the expiratory musculature (EMT) in these patients, both in isolation andconcurrently with inspiratory training. There are studies that have shown benefits inpostural stability and walking speed due to the strengthening of the central musculatureof the body.It would also be interesting to measure the medium‐ and long‐term effects of EMT, as sofar existing studies have not done so.Justification of available resources The University of Cadiz, through its Library, willprovide the bibliographic resources necessary for the development of this researchproject, such as access to the main publishers and indexed scientific journals.The HUVV will provide the facilities and materials used by the CRP for this study.The interviews and some of the pre‐ and post‐intervention measurements will be carriedout in the cardiac rehabilitation office of the HUVV.

AB  - Considerable numbers of patients undergo central venous catheterization (CVC) under mechanical ventilation. We hypothesized that the return of spontaneous breathing and tracheal extubation could be associated with distal CVC tip migration towards intracardiac positions due to decreasing intrathoracic pressures and subsequent readjustment of mediastinal organs. Patients scheduled for cardiac surgery were randomized for right or left internal jugular vein (IJV) CVC placement under general anesthesia and mechanical ventilation. CVC tips were positioned at the cavoatrial junction and measured at the time of placement, postoperatively under mechanical ventilation, and after tracheal extubation until 48 h after surgery. Measurement methods included intravascular electrocardiography (ECG) P‐wave amplitude, transesophageal echocardiography, and chest radiography (CXR). Out of 70 patients, 60 were eligible for final statistical analysis (31 right and 29 left IJV CVC). According to ECG interpretation, CVC tip positions remained below the pericardiac reflection point in the distal superior vena cava over the course of the three measurement intervals. The ECG revealed significant proximal migration of CVC tips from the time of placement to the time of tracheal extubation (1.19 ± 0.55 vs. 0.62 ± 0.31 mV; P < 0.001). A CXR using CVC tip to carina distances revealed no significant tip migrations in the time between postoperative assessment and following tracheal extubation (5.1 ± 1.7 vs. 5.3 ± 1.5 cm; P = 0.196). In patients with CVCs positioned at the cavoatrial junction, tracheal extubation was not associated with significant postoperative CVC tip malposition, but tended to undergo proximal migration. This trend should be considered particularly in left‐sided thoracocervical puncture approaches to avoid unfavorable CVC tip positions.

AB  - Background: Biological sex impacts myocardial remodeling and clinical outcomes in aortic stenosis (AS). Phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy (31P-MRS) non-invasively assesses myocardial phosphocreatine to ATP concentration ratio (PCr/ATP): a sensitive indicator of myocardial energetic status. Blood-oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) non-invasively assesses myocardial tissue oxygenation without exogenous contrast by measuring BOLD signal intensity (SI) differences, reflecting deoxygenated hemoglobin concentration during adenosine stress. The objective of this study was to determine sex differences in myocardial oxygenation (measured by BOLD signal intensity change between rest and adenosine stress BOLD CMR [BOLDΔSI]), and energetics (measured by PCr/ATP ratio) in severe AS without obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) before aortic valve replacement (AVR) and recovery post-AVR. Methods: This was a prospective single-center longitudinal cohort study (recruiting from April-2019 to November-2023), in a tertiary cardiovascular center. Patients with severe AS (n=202) undergoing AVR were recruited, alongside healthy controls (n=39). Participants underwent cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) 1-month prior (n=202) and 6-months post AVR (n=162). Significant obstructive CAD was excluded in AS patients by coronary angiography. Results: Patients were matched in age, AS severity and comorbidities. Pre AVR, both myocardial oxygenation and energetics indexes were significantly lower in female and male patients with severe AS compared to sex-matched healthy controls. However, there were no significant differences in BOLDΔSI (8.5[5.4,13.3] vs 6.9[2.8,12.1];P=0.063), or PCr/ATP ratio (1.72[1.48,1.87] vs 1.67[1.37,1.89];P=0.46) between female and male patients with AS (Figure 2). Significant improvements inBOLDΔSI were seen post AVR both in females (from 8.5[5.4,13.3] to 13.4[9.2,20.0];P=0.0013) and males (from 6.9[2.8,12.1] to 10.6[5.7,16.2];P=0.0003). Improvements in PCr/ATP were also shown in both females (from: 1.72[1.48,1.87] to 2.10[1.76,2.30]%;P=0.0005) and males (from 1.67[1.37,1.89] to 1.84[1.65,2.05]%;P=0.0026). Post-AVR measurements for PCr/ATP were significantly higher in the female AS group compared to the male AS group. In male AS patients, despite significant post AVR improvements, compared to sex matched controls bothBOLDΔSI (10.6[5.7,16.2] vs 16.1[10.8, 27.5]%,P=0.030) and PCr/ATP (1.84[1.65,2.05] vs 2.10[1.83,2.56];P=0.014) remained impaired. In the female group, the PCr/ATP ratio was no longer impaired compared to controls (2.10[1.76,2.30] vs 1.98[1.79,2.33],P=0.92). However similar to males the BOLDΔSI remained significantly impaired compared to female controls (13.4[9.2,20.0] vs 21.2[17.9,24.6]%;P=0.0020). Pre- and post AVR, there was no significant differences in LV systolic function between female and males patients with AS, or compared to sex matched controls. Global longitudinal shortening (GLS) was significantly lower in females and males with AS pre AVR compared to controls, remaining significantly impaired post AVR despite improvements in both sexes. GLS correlated with BOLDΔSI value (r=0.27, p=< 0.0001). Conclusion In patients with severe AS without obstructive CAD, biological sex does not significantly impact myocardial energetics or oxygenation pre or post-AVR with significant improvements in energetics and oxygenation detected in both sexes post-AVR.

AB  - Background: Biological sex impacts the myocardial remodeling and clinical outcomes in aortic stenosis (AS). Impaired myocardial perfusion is an independent predictor of adverse cardiovascular events in AS. Varying patterns of ventricular remodeling in AS may cause varying myocardial perfusion effects and symptoms. This work aimed to determine sex differences in myocardial perfusion in severe AS without obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) pre-AVR and its recovery post-AVR. Methods: This was a prospective single-center longitudinal cohort study with recruitment from April-2019 to November-2023, in a tertiary cardiovascular center. Patients with severe symptomatic AS (n=202, 70 women) undergoing AVR were recruited, alongside healthy controls (n=39, 18 women). Participants underwent cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) 1-month before (n=202) and 6-months post-AVR (n=162). Significant obstructive CAD was excluded in all AS patients by coronary angiography. Main outcomes: The sex-specific differences in myocardial perfusion recovery (rest and adenosine stress myocardial blood flow [MBF], myocardial perfusion reserve [MPR], endocardial to epicardial [Endo:Epi] MBF ratio) with AVR. Results: Patients were matched in age (combined age:73[72,76] years), AS severity and comorbidities. While women had higher surgical risk scores (Society of Thoracic Surgeons Score 1.66[1.15,3.27] vs 0.98[0.71,1.44], P<0.0001), the study overall consisted of low-surgical risk participants. Pre-AVR, women exhibited higher global-stress-MBF (1.37[1.18-1.75] vs 1.32[1.24-1.41]ml/min/g; P=0.0139) and rest-MBF (0.78[0.74-0.83] vs 0.64[0.54-0.72]ml/min/g, P<0.0001) compared to men, but no difference in MPR. Post-AVR, both sexes experienced similar relative increments in global-stress-MBF (22[6-38]% vs 25[14-36]%; P=0.127) and MPR (26[11-40] vs 26[15-37]%,P=0.96), and a non-significant reduction in rest-MBF. However, global-stress-MBF (1.93[1.71-2.15] vs 1.62[1.50-1.74]ml/min/g; P=0.0064) and rest-MBF (0.75[0.69-0.80] vs 0.60[0.52-0.70]ml/min/g; P<0.0001) remained higher in women with no difference in post-AVR MPR between the sexes (2.51[2.32-2.70] vs 2.50[2.31-2.69]; P=0.93). While pre-AVR rest or stress Endo:Epi MBF ratios were not significantly different between the sexes, post-AVR only men showed significant increase in both rest (1.03[1.01-1.04] to 1.09[1.07-1.10];P<0.0001) and stress (0.81[0.78-0.85] to 0.89[0.86-0.92];P<0.0001) Endo:Epi MBF ratios. Conclusion: In patients with severe AS without obstructive CAD, there is a persistent impact of biological sex on global myocardial perfusion both before and after AVR. However, with AVR both sexes show similar rates of relative improvements in global stress-MBF and MPR, and a decrease in global rest-MBF with AVR, while only men exhibit a significant change in transmyocardial MBF ratios.

AB  - Background: Stroke is a recognized complication following transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Although females have historically had a higher rate of bleeding and vascular complications after TAVR, contemporary data on sex differences in post-TAVR stroke and stroke severity are lacking. Disabling strokes significantly impact quality of life and outcomes, underscoring the need to explore sex-specific variations in post-TAVR stroke risk. Methods: We included all patients who underwent TAVR in the National Inpatient Sample from 2016-2021. Stroke and stroke severity were ascertained using validated claims-based algorithms. Disabling strokes were defined as those resulting in death or discharge to a non-home location. We used multivariable logistic regression to evaluate the association between sex and stroke while adjusting for covariates, including cerebral embolic protection use, and accounting for survey weights. Results: Among 76,882 patients (41% female), females demonstrated higher overall in-hospital stroke incidence compared with males (2.31% vs 1.69%, aOR 1.18 (95% CI: 1.04-1.35); Figure). This difference was driven primarily by disabling strokes, which were more common in females (1.61% vs. 1.02%, aOR 1.31 (95% CI: 1.11-1.54)). Conversely, the incidence of non-disabling stroke incidence was similar between sexes (0.70% vs. 0.67%, aOR 1.00 (95% CI: 0.81-1.23)). Conclusion: Among patients undergoing TAVR in contemporary practice, females had a higher rate of any stroke and disabling strokes compared with males. These findings emphasize the need for tailored strategies to mitigate stroke risk and improve outcomes for female TAVR patients. [Formula presented]

AB  - Objective: Women are less likely to receive guideline-recommended cardiovascular care, but evaluation of sex-based disparities in cardiac surgical procedures is limited. Receipt of concomitant atrial fibrillation (AF) procedures during nonmitral cardiac surgery was compared by sex for patients with preoperative AF. Methods: Patients with preoperative AF undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting and/or aortic valve replacement at any of the 33 hospitals in Michigan from 2014 to 2022 were included. Patients with prior cardiac surgery, transcatheter AF procedure, or emergency/salvage status were excluded. Hierarchical logistic regression identified predictors of concomitant AF procedures, account for hospital and surgeon as random effects. Results: Of 5460 patients with preoperative AF undergoing nonmitral cardiac surgery, 24% (n = 1291) were women with a mean age of 71 years. Women were more likely to have paroxysmal (vs persistent) AF than men (80% vs 72%; P < .001) and had a higher mean predicted risk of mortality (5% vs 3%; P < .001). The unadjusted rate of concomitant AF procedure was 59% for women and 67% for men (P < .001). After risk adjustment, women had 26% lower adjusted odds of concomitant AF procedure than men (adjusted odds ratio, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.64-0.86; P < .001). Female sex was the risk factor associated with the lowest odds of concomitant AF procedure. Conclusions: Women are less likely to receive guideline recommended concomitant AF procedure during nonmitral surgery. Identification of barriers to concomitant AF procedure in women may improve treatment of AF.

AB  - Background: Infective endocarditis (IE) presents significant morbidity and mortality, with potential sex differences in clinical profile and outcomes. This is the first meta-analysis that aims to compare the clinical profile and outcomes of IE between males and females. Methods: We conducted a meta-analysis of nine studies evaluating the clinical profile and outcomes of IE in males versus females extracted from PubMed, EMBASE, SCOPUS, and Cochrane databases up to 1st of Jan 2024. Results: Our meta-analysis revealed notable sex differences in the incidence and complications of IE. Males exhibited a higher incidence of aortic valve IE (RR 1.57, 95 % CI [1.31, 1.88]), surgical indications for IE (RR 1.38, [1.12, 1.70]), Streptococci infection (RR 1.36, [1.04, 1.77]), intracardiac abscess (RR 1.22, [1.05, 1.42]), and Enterococci IE (RR 1.44, [1.28, 1.61]). In contrast, females had a higher incidence of mitral valve IE (RR 0.79, [0.67, 0.94]) and a higher in-hospital mortality rate (RR 0.84, [0.74, 0.96]). No significant sex differences were found in the incidence of valve vegetations, tricuspid valve IE, embolization, and Staphylococcus IE. In-hospital stay was longer in male patients, however, with borderline significance (RR 3.15, [-0.16, 6.45], p = 0.06). In patients who underwent surgery for IE, mortality rates were significantly lower in male patients (RR: 0.67 [0.59, 0.76], p < 0.01). Conclusions: Compared to females, males exhibit higher rates of aortic valve IE, intracardiac abscess, streptococci IE, enterococci IE and IE-related surgery indication. In contrast, females have higher rates of mitral valve IE and in-hospital mortality.

AB  - Background and Aim: In recent years, there has been a rise in cryptogenic hepatocellular carcinoma (c-HCC) cases in Japan, posing a detection challenge due to an unknown etiology. This study aims to enhance diagnostic strategies for c-HCC by analyzing its characteristics and exploring current opportunities for detection. Methods: A retrospective study was conducted from April 2012 to March 2022, enrolling 372 newly diagnosed hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. Excluding cases associated with hepatitis viral infection, alcoholic liver disease, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease/steatohepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis, primary biliary cholangitis, and congestive hepatopathy, the study specifically focused on genuine c-HCC. The analysis delved into the characteristics, detection opportunities, and survival outcomes associated with c-HCC. Results: Among the non-viral HCC cases, 55 patients (29.3%) (34 men and 21 women) were diagnosed with c-HCC, making it the second-highest etiology. Notably, individuals with c-HCC, typically aged 60 and above (median age 76.0), exhibited a women predominance and presented with larger tumors (4.5 cm vs. 2.5 cm), correlating with a poorer prognosis. Cirrhosis was notably absent in most c-HCC cases (72.7%), and more than half (56.4%) did not have diabetes mellitus (DM). Diagnostic pathways for c-HCC primarily involved incidental imaging (47%) and symptoms (24%). Within the cohort of c-HCC, the prognosis for symptomatic cases is notably unfavorable compared to other cases [median survival time 19.0 (7.0–45.0) months vs. 47.0 (29.0–76.0) months, p = 0.029]. In the multivariate regression analysis, age and women emerged as independent factors associated with c-HCC. Rather than a significant increase in women, there is a narrowing gender gap. Conclusion: Patients with c-HCC were predominantly elderly, without cirrhosis or diabetes, and exhibited minimal gender differences. Detection often occurred incidentally through abdominal imaging. Considering the limitations of conventional surveillance, it seems reasonable to propose that abdominal imaging be included in cancer screening, particularly for individuals aged 60 and older. Trial Registration: 1610A127.

AB  - Background: Severe aortic stenosis (AS) stratified by sex has been increasingly studied in the European population. Sex-specific outcomes in Asian patients with AS remain poorly defined. Hence, we aimed to study the clinical characteristics and impact of sex in moderate-to-severe AS, undergoing both invasive and conservative interventions in an Asian cohort over 10 years. Methods: Consecutive data with echocardiographic diagnoses of AS were stratified according to gender in a tertiary academic center between 2011 and 2021. Demographics, comorbidities, and clinical outcomes were compared. Results: Seven hundred and three (703) patients were included (56%, n = 397 were female). Calcific AS was the dominant etiology in both genders. Females had higher incidences of anemia (p < 0.001) and chronic kidney disease (p = 0.026); although, females had lower incidences of cardiovascular complications of coronary artery disease (CAD) (p = 0.002) and prior acute myocardial infarction (AMI) (p = 0.015). Echocardiographically, females had a smaller left ventricular outflow tract diameter (LVOTd) (p < 0.001), LV mass (p < 0.001), and left ventricle end diastolic volume (LVEDV) (p < 0.001). Conversely, the left atrial (LA) area (p < 0.001) and volume index (LAVI) (p < 0.001) were larger in females. Females had higher average E/e’ (p = 0.010) ratios compared to males. The mean follow-up duration between genders was 4.1 ± 3.3 years. Upon univariate analysis, a greater proportion of female AS patients encountered cardiovascular (CV) hospitalization during follow-up (female: 27.5%, n = 109 vs. male: 18.3%, n = 56; p = 0.005) compared to male patients, but there were no significant differences for the outcomes of heart failure (p = 0.612), stroke (p = 0.664), and all-cause mortality (p = 0.827). Fewer females underwent aortic valve (AV) intervention compared to males (21.2% vs. 27.8%, p = 0.042), albeit with a longer duration to AV intervention (3.6 years ± 2.4 vs. 2.6 years ± 2.3, p = 0.016). In the severe AS cohort, female sex remained an independent predictor for subsequent heart failure (aHR 2.89, 95% CI 1.01–8.29, p = 0.048) and CV hospitalization (aHR 20.0, 95% CI 1.19–335, p = 0.037) after adjustments for age, ethnicity, body mass index (BMI), comorbidities, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), and AV intervention. Conclusions: There was no difference in heart failure, stroke, and all-cause mortality outcomes between male and female Asian patients with moderate-to-severe AS. However, there were more cardiovascular hospitalizations, with fewer and longer duration to AV intervention in females compared to males in our cohort.

AB  - Aims It is not well known if sex differences in the use and results of aortic valve replacement (AVR) are changing. The aim of the study is to assess the time trends in the differences by sex in the utilization of AVR procedures in hospitals and in the community. Methods and Retrospective observational analysis using data from the Spanish National Hospitalizations Administrative Database. All Results hospitalizations between 2016 and 2021 with a main diagnosis of aortic stenosis (International Classification of Diseases-10 codes: I35.0 and I35.2) were included. Time trends in hospitalization, AVRs, and hospital outcomes were analysed. Crude utilization and population-standardized rates were calculated. During the study period, 64 384 hospitalizations in 55 983 patients (55.5% men) with 36 915 (65.9%) AVR were recorded. Of these, 15 563 (42.2%) were transcatheters and 21 432 (58.0%) were surgical. At the hospital level, transcatheter procedures were more frequently performed in women (32.3% vs. 24.2%, P < 0.001), and surgical in men (42.9% vs. 32.5%, P < 0.001) but at the population level, surgical and transcatheter aortic valve replacements (TAVRs) were used more frequently in men (12.6 surgical and 8.0 transcatheter per 100 000 population) vs. women (6.4 and 5.8, respectively; P < 0.001 for both comparisons). Transcatheter procedures shifted from 17.3% in 2016 to 38.0% in 2021, overtaking surgical procedures in 2018 for women and 2021 for men. Conclusions TAVR has displaced surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) as the most frequent AVR procedure in Spain by 2020. This occurred earlier in women, who, despite the greater weight of their age group in the older population, received fewer AVRs, both SAVR and TAVR.

AB  - Objective: The anatomic considerations of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) have an important role for the procedure planning; however, sex-specific data are lacking. Methods: All eligible cases undergoing evaluation for TAVI procedure in the period from November 2019 to July 2023 at the University Hospital of Split were included. Cardiac computed tomography was analyzed to derive the measures of left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT), aortic root, ascending aorta, and ilio-femoral arteries. A sex-based comparison was conducted using the descriptive statistics. Results: There were 140 female (43.8%) and 180 male patients (56.2%). Female patients had smaller dimensions of aortic annulus (area 391.9 vs. 491.5 mm2, p < 0.001), LVOT (area 373.3 vs. 481.8 mm2, p < 0.001), and ascending aorta (maximal diameter 32.7 vs. 34.5 mm, p < 0.001), as well as ilio-femoral arteries bilaterally (p < 0.001). There was no significant difference in the proportion of ilio-femoral unfeasibility for transfemoral TAVI procedure, as measured by diameter of ilio-femoral arteries <5.0 mm (9.0% in males vs. 6.1% in females, p = 0.441) and <5.5 mm (24.7% in males vs. 16.7% in females, p = 0.156). Female patients were more likely to receive the smallest valve across different valve platforms (p < 0.001). There were sex-specific differences in the availability of conventional valve sizes across different platforms (p < 0.001). Female patients had significantly higher periprocedural mortality (7.9% vs. 1.7%, p = 0.030), whereas there were no differences in other clinical outcomes and no association of periprocedural mortality with anatomic measures. Conclusion: Female patients showed smaller absolute dimensions of LVOT, aortic root, and ilio-femoral arteries than male patients. There were no differences in the prevalence of ilio-femoral unfeasibility for the transfemoral TAVI procedure; however, there were sex-specific differences in the availability of conventional valve sizes across different platforms. Female patients exhibited a higher periprocedural mortality, with no difference in other clinical outcomes.

AB  - Calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) shows in the deposition of calcium phosphates in the collagen-rich layer of the valve leaflets. This stiffens the leaflets and eventually leads to heart failure. Recent research suggests that CAVD follows sex-specific pathways: at the same severity of the disease, women tend to have fewer and less crystalline calcifications, and the phases of their calcifications are decidedly different than those of men; namely, dicalcium phosphate dihydrate (DCPD) – one of the mineral phases in CAVD - occurs almost exclusively in females. Furthermore, the morphologies of heart valve calcifications might be sex-specific, but the sex dependence of the morphologies has not been systematically investigated. Herein, we first show that male CAVD patients have more compact and less fibrous calcifications than females, establishing sex-dependent morphological features of heart valve calcification. We then build a model that recapitulates the sex differences of the calcifications in CAVD, which is based on a collagen gel that we calcify in simulated body fluid with varying fetuin A concentrations. With increasing fetuin A concentration, the calcifications become less crystalline and more fibrous, and more DCPD deposits in the collagen matrix, resembling the physicochemical characteristics of the calcifications in female valves. Lower fetuin A concentrations give rise to a model that replicates male-specific mineral characteristics. The models could be used to develop sex-specific detection and treatment methods for CAVD. Statement of Significance: Although calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) affects ∼10 million people globally, researchers have only discovered recently that the disease follows sex-specific pathways, and many of its sex-specific features remain unknown. To further our understanding of sex differences in CAVD and to develop better detection and treatment methods, there is an urgent need to establish models for CAVD that account for its sex-specific manifestations. In this study, we first show that CAVD calcifications in men and women take on different morphologies. Second, we present a model that can replicate physicochemical calcification characteristics of male or female valves, including morphology, and that can help to develop sex-specific detection and treatment methods for CAVD.

AB  - Background: Sex differences in the prevalence and characteristics of cardiac pathologies, including aortic stenosis (AS), are well-documented. For instance, females with severe AS exhibit lower degrees of calcification but higher levels of fibrosis compared to males. This study aims to evaluate sex-based differences in in-hospital outcomes among patients with AS undergoing balloon aortic valvuloplasty (BAV). Methods: National Inpatient Sample database was queried from 2015 to 2019, identifying adult patients with severe nonrheumatic AS undergoing BAV using ICD-10 codes. Statistical analyses included Chi-Squared tests for initial comparisons followed by logistic regression to adjust for covariates. Results: The study included 19,510 patients: 10,556 males (54.1 %) and 8954 females (45.9 %). Females demonstrated lower rates of post-procedural in-hospital mortality, acute kidney injury, infection, ventricular arrhythmias, and pneumothorax, however higher incidence of stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA), red blood cell transfusions, vascular complications, and pericardial effusion. Adjusted analysis revealed female patients had lower mortality rates (OR 0.89; 95 % CI [0.79–1.0]; p = 0.042), but higher rates of red blood cell transfusions (OR 1.6; 95 % CI [1.4–1.8]; p < 0.001) and vascular complications (OR 1.5; 95 % CI [1.3–1.8]; p < 0.001), without significant difference in stroke (OR 1.1; 95 % CI [0.91–1.3]; p = 0.309). Conclusions: Females undergoing BAV for severe AS experienced lower in-hospital mortality but higher rates of vascular complications and red blood cell transfusions compared to males. These findings underscore the importance of a sex-specific approach in the management of AS to reduce adverse outcomes and optimize patient care.

AB  - Objective: The study objective was to compare sex and racial differences in 180-day infection rates after coronary artery bypass grafting and aortic valve replacement. Methods: A statewide Society of Thoracic Surgeons Adult Cardiac Surgery Database was linked to Medicare claims data to identify 8887 beneficiaries undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting and aortic valve replacement (surgical or transcatheter) between 2017 and 2021. The primary outcome was the incidence of 180-day infection. Secondary outcomes included 10 infection subtypes. Multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate the relationship between sex and race (Black vs non-Black) and infections. Two secondary analyses were conducted: (1) robustness of the primary analysis after excluding urinary tract infections given established sex-related differences and (2) testing a sex∗race interaction. Results: The mean (SD) age of the cohort was 74.5 (8.9) years, with 36.9% female and 4.2% Black. The infection rate was 19.6%, although this varied by patient sex (female vs male: 23.7% vs 17.1%) and race (Black vs non-Black: 28.0% vs 19.2%), both P less than .0001. Differences in infection rates for female patients were driven by urinary tract infections and pneumonia for Black patients. Risk-adjusted odds of infection were 1.6-fold significantly higher among female patients but nonsignificant for Black patients. A sex∗race interaction was present, with non-Black female patients versus non-Black male patients having a 1.63 higher odds of infection. Conclusions: This multicenter study identified a 1.6-fold higher odds of infection among female patients. Non-Black female versus male patients had a 63% higher odds of infection. Transdisciplinary collaborative learning interventions should be considered to address these known disparities in infection rates.

AB  - Importance: Female patients have higher mortality rates after high-risk surgery than male patients. It is unknown whether this mortality gap is due to different rates of postoperative complications or if complications are addressed differently by sex, causing complications to lead to death-so-called failure to rescue. Objective: To evaluate sex differences in failure to rescue across high-risk surgical procedures. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective cohort study was conducted using data from Medicare beneficiaries from October 2015 to February 2020 who underwent high-risk vascular or cardiac surgical procedures, including abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, coronary artery bypass grafting, aortic valve replacement, and mitral valve replacement or repair. Data analysis was performed from August 2023 to March 2024. Exposures: The primary exposure was patient sex. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcomes were risk-adjusted rates of complications, 30-day mortality, and failure to rescue, which was defined as a death occurring after a serious complication. Categorical variables are presented as frequencies and proportions and compared using χ2 analysis. Continuous variables were tested for normality and compared using a t test. Results: A total of 863 305 Medicare beneficiaries were included in this study cohort, of whom 304 176 (35.2%) were female. Mean (SD) age was slightly higher in female patients (74.8 [9.3] years) than male patients (73.4 [8.5] years), and female patients had more comorbidities than male patients (≥2 Elixhauser comorbidities, female: 262 809 [86.4%] vs male: 465 231 [83.2%]). Female patients were more likely to receive care at large hospitals and hospitals with a higher surgical case volume. Overall, female and male patients had similar rates of complications (female: 14.98% vs male: 14.37%; adjusted relative risk [aRR], 1.04; 95% CI, 1.03-1.05; P < .001). However, female patients had higher rates of 30-day mortality (female: 4.22% vs male: 3.34%; aRR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.23-1.29; P < .001) and higher rates of failure to rescue (female: 10.71% vs male: 8.58%; aRR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.22-1.28; P < .001). A similar pattern was observed when stratified by each procedure. Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study among Medicare beneficiaries undergoing high-risk surgery, male and female patients experienced similar rates of serious complications, but female patients with complications were more likely to die. In other words, clinicians fail to rescue female patients with complications after high-risk surgery more often than male patients. Improving the recognition and management of female patients' complications postoperatively may narrow the sex disparity after high-risk surgery.

AB  - Objectives: Although cardiogenic shock requiring extracorporeal life support after cardiac surgery is associated with high mortality, the impact of sex on outcomes of postcardiotomy extracorporeal life support remains unclear with conflicting results in the literature. We compare patient characteristics, in-hospital outcomes, and overall survival between females and males requiring postcardiotomy extracorporeal life support. Methods: This retrospective, multicenter (34 centers), observational study included adults requiring postcardiotomy extracorporeal life support between 2000 and 2020. Preoperative, procedural, and extracorporeal life support characteristics, complications, and survival were compared between females and males. Association between sex and in-hospital survival was investigated through mixed Cox proportional hazard models. Results: This analysis included 1823 patients (female: 40.8%; median age: 66.0 years [interquartile range, 56.2-73.0 years]). Females underwent more mitral valve surgery (females: 38.4%, males: 33.1%, P = .019) and tricuspid valve surgery (feamales: 18%, males: 12.4%, P < .001), whereas males underwent more coronary artery surgery (females: 45.9%, males: 52.4%, P = .007). Extracorporeal life support implantation was more common intraoperatively in feamales (females: 64.1%, females: 59.1%) and postoperatively in males (females: 35.9%, males: 40.9%, P = .036). Ventricular unloading (females: 25.1%, males: 36.2%, P < .001) and intra-aortic balloon pumps (females: 25.8%, males: 36.8%, P < .001) were most frequently used in males. Females had more postoperative right ventricular failure (females: 24.1%, males: 19.1%, P = .016) and limb ischemia (females: 12.3%, males: 8.8%, P = .23). In-hospital mortality was 64.9% in females and 61.9% in males (P = .199) with no differences in 5-year survival (females: 20%, 95% CI, 17-23; males: 24%, 95% CI, 21-28; P = .069). Crude hazard ratio for in-hospital mortality in females was 1.12 (95% CI, 0.99-1.27; P = .069) and did not change after adjustments. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that female and male patients requiring postcardiotomy extracorporeal life support have different preoperative and extracorporeal life support characteristics, as well as complications, without a statistical difference in in-hospital and 5-year survivals.

AB  - Background: The short-term and midterm impact of gender differences on transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has been studied. However, the impact on long-term clinical outcomes remains unclear. The objective of the study was to investigate the impact of gender differences after TAVI on long-term clinical outcomes and structural valve deterioration (SVD). Methods: Of the 672 consecutive patients who underwent TAVI, with balloon- or self-expandable valves, between 2013 and 2018, a total of 511 who underwent multidetector computed tomography analysis within 30 days after TAVI were included. Echocardiographic data were analyzed annually. Results: The number of women was 343 (67.2%), and 90.7% of them had a small annulus (< 430 mm2). The effective orifice area was significantly smaller in women compared with that in men, whereas no difference occurred in the incidence of prosthesis–patient mismatch. The incidence of leaflet thrombosis detected by multidetector computed tomography was similar for women vs men (15.2% vs 13.1%, respectively; P = 0.53). During the median follow-up of 1844 days (interquartile range: 1190-2311 days), women showed a significantly decreased incidence of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio, 0.69; 95% confidence interval, 0.54-0.90; P = 0.005). The development of SVD was comparable (hazard ratio, 0.99; 95% confidence interval, 0.78-1.25, P = 0.90). Severe frailty and the balloon-expandable valves were the independent risk factors for all-cause mortality and SVD in women, respectively. Conclusions: Women had superior long-term clinical outcomes, compared with those of men, despite their having a small annulus. During long-term follow-up, the incidence of SVD in women was similar in the entire cohort, compared to that in men; however, balloon-expandable valves were possible risk factors for SVD in women.

AB  - Objective: Female sex is associated with increased mortality within Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting and valve-surgery. Recent literature fails to identify the same association for aortic surgery but less is known of the long term mortality (>5 years). The objective of this study was to compare short-term (30-day, 1-year and 5-year) and long-term (20-year) mortality between female and male patients undergoing aortic surgery. Design and method: This retrospective observational study analysed prospectively collected quality assurance data of patients who underwent cardiac surgery in the Amsterdam UMC, between January 2001 and December 2020. All adult patients (>18 years) undergoing aortic surgery were included. Aortic surgery included all acute and elective procedures, in which any part of the thoracic aorta was involved. Descriptive statistics were used for incidence rates, Fisher's Exact test for the assessment of differences in mortality, and Kaplan-Meier and Cox Proportional Hazard regression for analysing and adjusting for potential confounders. Results and conclusions: Preliminary results: A total of 11 675 patients were admitted for cardiac surgery. Of these, 675 patients underwent aortic surgery procedures, with 219 (32%) females and 456 (68%) males. Females were significantly older at the time of surgery compared to males (67±11 years vs. 61±12 years, p<.001), had a higher rate of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (p=.035) and a lower eGFR (p<.001). Males had a higher rate of abnormal left ventricular function (p=.046) and previous heart surgery (p=.014), while females had a smaller body surface area (p<.001). No significant difference in surgical urgency was observed between females and males (p=.868). Mortality at 30 days (29 (13%) vs. 56 (12%), p=.712), one year (42 (19%) vs. 79 (17%), p=.592) and five years (63 (29%) vs. 107 (24%), p=.155) was similar between sexes. Long term mortality at 20 years was significantly higher in females compared to males (107 (49%) vs. 172 (38%), p=.007). After adjusting this analysis for age, Cox Proportional Hazards regression did not find a significant association between sex and mortality (odds ratio=0.988, confidence interval [0.769-1.268], p=.922). Conclusions: The short- and intermediate-term mortality rates at 30 days, one year, and five years between females and males, where similar. The significantly higher long-term mortality at 20 years in females, suggests a potential long-term survival discrepancy which may be influenced by factors other than sex alone. Females undergoing aortic surgery were older than males, indicating a potential age-related difference in the patient population. Future research should focus on identifying factors responsible for the apparent sex disparity in cardiac surgery.

AB  - Background: There are no sex-specific guidelines for chronic aortic regurgitation (AR). This retrospective study examined sex-specific differences and propose treatment criteria from an Asian AR cohort. Methods and Results: Consecutive 1,305 patients with moderate-severe AR or greater at 3 tertiary centers in Taiwan and Japan (2008–2022) were identified. Study endpoints were aortic valve surgery (AVS), all-cause death (ACD), and cardiovascular death (CVD). The median follow up was 3.9 years (interquartile range 1.3–7.1 years). Compared with men (n=968), women (n=337) were older, had more advanced symptoms, more comorbidities, larger indexed aorta size (iAortamax) and indexed left ventricular (LV) end-systolic dimension (LVESDi; P<0.001 for all). Symptomatic status was poorly correlated with the degree of LV remodeling in women (P≥0.18). Women received fewer AVS (P≤0.001) and men had better overall 10-year survival (P<0.01). Ten-year post-AVS survival (P=0.9) and the progression of LV remodeling were similar between sexes (P≥0.16). Multivariable determinants of ACD and CVD were age, advanced symptoms, iAortamax, LV ejection fraction (LVEF), LVESDi, LV end-systolic volume index (LVESVi), and Taiwanese ethnicity (all P<0.05), but not female sex (P≥0.05). AVS was associated with better survival (P<0.01). Adjusted LVEF, LVESDi, LVESVi, and iAortamax cut-off values for ACD were 53%, 24.8mm/m2, 44mL/m2, and 25.5mm/m2, respectively, in women and 52%, 23.4mm/m2, 52mL/m2, and 23.2mm/m2, respectively, in men. Conclusions: Early detection and intervention using sex-specific cut-off values may improve survival in women with AR.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent evidence indicates that degenerative valvular heart disease (VHD) and psoriasis share overlapping risk factors and simultaneous presence of inflammation, yet this relationship has not been thoroughly explored. METHODS: Drawing on the prospective cohort data from the UK Biobank, baseline information on psoriasis and the incidence of eight specific types of degenerative VHD-aortic stenosis (AS), aortic regurgitation, mitral stenosis, mitral regurgitation, tricuspid stenosis, tricuspid regurgitation, pulmonary stenosis, and pulmonary regurgitation-during the follow-up period were recorded. Cox proportional hazards models were conducted to estimate the association between psoriasis and the risk of degenerative VHD, adjusted for demographic indicators, lifestyle factors, comorbidities, and medication. RESULTS: A total of 494 510 participants were included in the study. Among the participants without psoriasis, 13 672 events of degenerative VHD were observed during a median follow-up of 13.78 years, yielding an incidence rate of 2.14 per 1 000 person-years. In contrast, In the psoriasis group (n = 10 917), 422 events of degenerative VHD were reported during a median follow-up of 13.70 years, corresponding to an incidence rate of 2.93 per 1 000 person-years. After fully adjusting, participants with psoriasis had a significantly increased risk of AS (HR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.07-1.43), yet no significant associations were observed between psoriasis and the risk of other degenerative valve diseases. In sex subgroup analyses, there was an interaction between sex and psoriasis in the occurrence of AS (p-interaction = 0.039), suggesting a high risk in women. CONCLUSIONS: Psoriasis was significantly associated with the risk of new-onset AS and may be more distinct in females, while no significant associations were observed between psoriasis and the risk of developing other degenerative valve diseases.

AB  - Aortic stenosis (AS) is the most common valvular heart disease in developed countries, and its prevalence is higher in older patients. Clinical studies have shown gender disparity in the pathogenesis and the progression of aortic stenosis. This disparity has led to several overwhelming questions regarding its impact on the clinical outcomes and treatment of the disease and the requirement of personalized sex-specific approaches for its management. Indeed, aortic stenosis differs in the pathophysiological response to pressure overload created by the stenosis in women compared to men, which would translate into differences in cardiac remodeling and clinical outcomes. Several studies have focused on understanding the differences regarding disease progression according to biological gender and have found that sex hormones play a crucial role. Sex hormones affect many metabolic processes, thus activating crucial cell signaling and energy metabolism through mitochondrial activity. Yet, there is still a significant gap in knowledge on how biological sex influences the pathophysiology of AS. In this review, we have discussed studies that point to the role of sex-related physiological differences in the molecular pathways and the clinical presentation of the disease and outcome in women and men. We used the format of narrative review to review and summarize the body of literature without being systematic but with taking great care of considering the most impactful data available to date on the topic, especially randomized trials, metanalyses, and prospective studies and registries when available, as well as experimental studies with rigorous methodological approaches regarding the basic mechanisms and pathophysiology of the disease in women compared to men. The opinion of the authors on a particular issue or finding was expressed when appropriate for clarification.

AB  - Background: Previous studies on the impact of sex differences after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) have shown conflicting results. The aim was to analyze the risk of long-term mortality, heart failure hospitalization, myocardial infarction, stroke, bleeding and aortic valve reintervention in females versus males after TAVR. Methods: This nationwide, population-based cohort study included all patients who underwent TAVR in Sweden between 2008 and 2022 from the SWEDEHEART register. Additional baseline and outcome data were gathered from other national health data registers. Regression standardization was used to adjust for differences between the sexes. Results: Of 10,475 patients, 4,886 (47%) were female and 5,589 (53%) were male. The mean age was 81 years. The cumulative incidence of mortality at 1, 5, and 10 years was 8% vs. 10%, 38% vs. 45%, and 75% vs. 82% for females and males, respectively. After regression standardization, the risk of all-cause mortality was lower for females (absolute difference at 10 years of 6.4%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 4.4%-8.4%). The mean follow up was 3.1 years (maximum 14.1 years). Females also had a lower risk of major bleeding than males (absolute survival difference at 10 years of 4.0%, 95% CI 1.9%-6.2%), but there was no difference in the risk of heart failure, myocardial infarction, stroke, or reintervention between the sexes. Conclusions: Females had a higher survival rate and a lower bleeding risk than males after TAVR. Sex-specific factors are important to consider in the management of patients after TAVR.

AB  - Background: Aortic valve disease is common in adults with coarctation of aorta. However, no systematic comparative analyses have been performed of the clinical course of aortic valve disease for male vs female patients in this population. The purpose of this study was to compare cardiac remodelling, onset of symptoms, and incidence of aortic valve replacement (AVR) for male vs female patients. Methods: A retrospective study was conducted of adults with repaired coarctation of aorta and ≥ moderate aortic stenosis and/or aortic regurgitation. Cardiac remodelling (left ventricular [LV], left atrial, right ventricular [RV], and right atrial structure and function) and symptomatic and/or functional class were determined at the baseline encounter. Development of new-onset symptoms and the incidence of AVR were ascertained for the period from baseline to last encounter. Results: We identified 214 patients (121 male [57%], 93 female [43%]). Although both groups had a similar aortic valve gradient, aortic valve area indexed to body surface area, aortic regurgitation severity, and functional status at baseline, female patients had more LV concentric hypertrophy and remodelling, left atrial hypertension and dysfunction, elevated RV systolic pressure, and RV systolic dysfunction. Of 151 patients without symptoms at baseline,102 (72%) developed symptoms. Female sex was independently associated with new-onset symptoms (adjusted hazard ratio 1.14, [95% confidence interval 1.05-1.23]). Of 214 patients, 191 (89%) underwent AVR. Female sex was not associated with AVR upon multivariable analysis. However, LV concentric hypertrophy and remodelling (both of which were more common in female patients) were associated with new-onset symptoms and AVR. Conclusions: Female patients, compared to male patients, had more-advanced cardiac remodelling, and more-rapid onset of symptoms, but a similar risk of AVR.

AB  - Background: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVR) is a well-established treatment for symptomatic patients with aortic stenosis. Yet the impact of sex differences and public vs private procedural setting on TAVR outcomes remain uncertain. Methods: The RIBAC-NT (Brazilian Registry for Evaluation of Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement Outcomes) dataset included 3,194 TAVR patients from 2009 to 2021. This retrospective analysis explored disparities in baseline characteristics and procedural and in-hospital outcomes, stratifying patients by sex and procedural setting. Temporal trends were also investigated. Results: We included 1,551 (49%) female and 1,643 (51%) male patients. Women were older (83 years [78-87 years] vs 81 years [75-85 years]; P < 0.01) but had a lower prevalence of diabetes mellitus (30.2% vs 36.3%; P < 0.01) and coronary artery disease (39.0% vs 52.2%; P < 0.01). However, women had a 3-fold higher risk of life-threatening bleeding (6.1% vs 2.4%; P < 0.01). Women presented higher procedural and in-hospital mortality rates (4.4% vs 2.5% and 7.7% vs 4.5%; all P < 0.01, respectively). Over time, mortality rates decreased more in women than in men in both public and private centers. Public hospitals presented ∼2-fold higher procedural mortality rate compared with private settings (5.0% vs 2.7%; P < 0.01). [Formula presented] Conclusion: Women had higher procedural and in-hospital mortality rates after TAVR as compared with men, while facing higher life-threatening bleeding and adverse events rates. Public hospitals exhibited higher mortality rates than private centers. In recent years, women experienced more significant reductions in mortality rates in both settings.

AB  - Background: Moderate aortic stenosis (AS) has been associated with high mortality and adverse events. Sex differences in the presentation of moderate AS have not been studied in detail. We aimed to investigate sex differences in the symptomatic presentation and left ventricular (LV) geometric progression in moderate AS, with a secondary focus on outcomes. Methods: We enrolled 542 patients with a diagnosis of moderate AS. Echocardiographic and clinical data were collected longitudinally until aortic valve replacement (AVR) or death. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze baseline and follow-up differences and to describe longitudinal progression and changes in geometry. Cox regressions were used to compare time to symptom development, AVR, and mortality stratified by sex. Results: A total of 205 (37.8%) females and 337 (62.2%) males were enrolled with median age of 69. Women had more dyspnea than men. At baseline echocardiography, women had larger aortic valve area indexed to body surface area (AVAi), lower peak jet velocity, higher LVEF, lower left ventricular mass index (LVMI), larger relative wall thickness (RWT), and more diastolic dysfunction. These differences persisted at follow-up (median: 3.93 years). There were no significant sex differences in LV geometric patterns. The development of concentric hypertrophy did not vary by sex. Incidence and time to symptoms, AVR, or mortality did not differ by sex. [Formula presented] Conclusion: Patterns of LV geometry in patients with moderate aortic stenosis do not differ between the sexes over time. Women had more dyspnea at presentation. Time to symptom development, AVR, and mortality did not differ. Categories: STRUCTURAL: Valvular Disease: Aortic.

AB  - Background: Over the past decade, transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has emerged as a potent alternative to surgical aortic valve replacement for severe aortic stenosis. Gender disparities have been reported in previous studies for the uptake of early-generation TAVRs, but meager data are available when it comes to the new-generation heart valves. Perioperative outcomes, including bleeding rates, vascular complications, prolonged hospitalization, mortality rates, and so on, have been known to show statistically significant differences among both genders. In this cross-sectional study, our objective is to explore the gender variations that exist in the overall uptake of TAVRs in the United States using the National Inpatient Sample database. Methods: We used the National Inpatient Sample from 2016 to 2021 to identify patients who underwent TAVR. We then divided this sample based on gender and compared the groups using the Pearson chi-square test and Student’s t-test. To limit the effect of confounders, we also used a multivariate logistic model and reported adjusted ORs with P values. Results: We selected a cohort of 393,195 patients who underwent TAVR. Forty-four percent of these patients were females. Females who underwent TAVR were older (mean age: 79.26 vs 78.16 years; P < 0.001) and more likely to be covered by Medicare (90.5% vs 85.5%; P < 0.001). Multivariate analysis suggested that female gender was associated with higher odds of in-hospital mortality (aOR: 1.32; P < 0.001), ischemic stroke (aOR: 1.29; P = 0.001), and acute bleeding (aOR: 1.35; P < 0.001) compared with males who underwent TAVR. Interestingly, females had lower odds of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (aOR: 0.83; P = 0.004), acute heart failure (aOR: 0.63; P < 0.001), and major adverse cardiac events (aOR: 0.92; P = 0.042). Conclusion: Female patients who underwent TAVR were at higher odds of in-hospital mortality, ischemic stroke, and acute bleeding while being at lower odds of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, acute heart failure, and major adverse cardiac events than males. The precise reasons for these correlations cannot be drawn with limited data, necessitating the need for future studies. It could be possibly because of a higher jet velocity, lower calcification rates, or underdiagnosis. Categories: STRUCTURAL: Valvular Disease: Aortic.

AB  - Background: Patients with coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) require routine antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy. For patients with a history of CABG undergoing secondary transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), the risk of bleeding increases. However, there is limited research on the relationship between gender differences and bleeding after TAVR combined with previous CABG. Methods: We queried the National Inpatient Sample (2012-2020) for hospitalized patients who underwent TAVR using International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-9 and ICD-10 codes. Our primary outcome of interest was major bleeding defined as a need for transfusion of blood products, gastrointestinal bleeding, and procedure-related bleeding among men and women. We also observed the time trend of bleeding incidence in both gender patients. Multiple regression analysis was conducted to evaluate the impact of gender on bleeding. Results: In this 9-year period, there were 10,786 patients with prior CABG undergoing TAVR included in this study, of whom 22.7% (n = 2,446) were women. Women were on average older (mean age in women was 79.46 years vs men 78.80 years, P < 0.001) and more often Black (4.42% vs 1.80%, P < 0.001) or non-White race (8.91% vs 7.11%, P < 0.001). In addition, women had higher comorbidity compared with men. After multivariable adjustment, women were associated with higher bleeding risk than men (aOR: 1.93; 95% CI: 1.35-2.31), especially in transfusion of blood products (aOR: 1.88; 95% CI: 1.59-2.22), gastrointestinal bleeding (aOR: 2.42; 95% CI: 1.50-3.89), and procedural bleeding (aOR: 1.54; 95% CI: 1.11-2.12). Rates of bleeding of women decreased from 39.5% in 2012 to 6.92% in 2020, and bleeding rate of men decreased from 11.5% to 5.5% (all P < 0.001). Conclusion: In this national cohort, among patients who undergoing TAVR with previous CABG, women had a higher comorbidity burden and worsening bleeding trends over the study period compared with men, especially in terms of transfusion of blood products, gastrointestinal bleeding, and procedural bleeding. Throughout the entire study period, bleeding risk of both women and men showed a decreasing trend. Categories: CORONARY: Complex and Higher Risk Procedures for Indicated Patients (CHIP).

AB  - Background: Sex-specific comparisons of valve-in-valve (ViV) transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) are scarce. We compared patient characteristics, procedural, and 1-year outcomes of female (F) versus male (M) patients undergoing ViV-TAVR. Methods: In 3 German centers, 375 patients were included, and the 1-year mortality was the primary outcome measure. Secondary outcomes included VARC-3 defined technical and device success and early safety. Results: Overall, 160 (42.6%) women and 215 (57.4%) men were included. Women were older (81 [77-84] vs 78 [74-82]; P < 0.01) and had a higher surgical risk (STS 9.1% [6.1%-13.9%] vs 6.3% [4.1%-9.6%]; P < 0.01) A failed valve size <20 mm was more common in women (59.4% vs 33.4%; P < 0.01) with higher gradients at baseline (40 [31-50] mm Hg vs 32 [25-42] mm Hg; P < 0.01). Aortic regurgitation was the mode of failure in 7.5% of women vs 14.4% of men (P = 0.04). The number of failed stentless valves was numerically higher in men (8.1% vs 14.0%; P = 0.08). The use of a self-expanding TAVR prosthesis was 79.4% in women and 75.8% in men, respectively. The rates of technical success (F 75.6% vs M 83.3%; P = 0.07), device success (F 52.5% vs M 58.2%; P = 0.27), and early safety (F 67.5% vs M 67.0%; P = 0.92) were similar between groups. Women exhibited numerically higher rates of bleeding (20.6% vs 13.4%; P = 0.07) and access site complications (21.9% vs 15.3%; P = 0.11). Stroke, myocardial infarction, kidney failure, and new pacemaker implantation were not different between groups. The rates of patients having a mean gradient ≥20 mm Hg were similar (F 34.6% vs M 27.3%; P = 0.13). Men had a higher rate of residual moderate/severe regurgitation (0.6% vs 5.1%; P = 0.05). The 30-day (F 2.5% vs M 3.3%; P = 0.66) and 1-year (F 10.0% vs M 7.4%; P = 0.37) mortalities were similar betweeen sexes. Sex was not associated with 1-year mortality (HR for M: 1.19; 95% CI: 0.53-2.69); P = 0.68), but STS remained an independent predictor (HR for 1% increase: 1.04; 95% CI: 1.01-1.07); P = 0.02). Conclusions: Female and male patients treated with ViV-TAVR had similar short-term outcomes according to VARC-3–defined endpoints and similar mortality rates at 30 days and 1 year.

AB  - Background and Aims To assess sex differences in disease characteristics and treatment of patients with severe native valvular heart disease (VHD) included in the VHD II EURObservational Research Programme. Methods A total of 5219 patients were enrolled in 208 European and North African centres and followed for 6 months [41.2% aortic stenosis (AS), 5.3% aortic regurgitation (AR), 4.5% mitral stenosis (MS), 21.3% mitral regurgitation (MR), 2.7% isolated right-sided VHD, 24.9% multiple left-sided VHD]. Indications for intervention were considered concordant if corresponding to class I recommendations specified in the 2012 ESC or 2014 AHA/ACC VHD guidelines. Results Overall, women were older, more symptomatic, and presented with a higher EuroSCORE II. Bicuspid aortic valve and AR were more prevalent among men while mitral disease, concomitant tricuspid regurgitation (TR), and AS above age 65 were more prevalent among women. On multivariable regression analysis, concordance with recommended treatment was significantly poorer in women with MS and primary MR (both P < .001). Age, patient refusal, and decline of symptoms after conservative treatment were reported significantly more often as reasons to withhold the intervention in females. Concomitant tricuspid intervention was performed at a similar rate in both sexes although prevalence of significant TR was significantly higher in women. In-hospital and 6-month survival did not differ between sexes. Conclusions (i) Valvular heart disease subtype varied between sexes; (ii) concordance with recommended intervention for MS and primary MR was significantly lower for women; and (iii) survival of men and women was similar at 6 months.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite its high prevalence, little is known about the effect of sex on the management and outcomes of aortic stenosis (AS). We sought to characterize the effect of sex on the clinical evaluation for and provision of aortic valve replacement (AVR), including surgical (SAVR) and transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), and subsequent morbidity and mortality outcomes. METHODS AND RESULTS: We completed a comprehensive chart review of all patients with a first diagnosis of severe AS at Vancouver General and University of British Columbia Hospitals between 2012 and 2022. Chi-square and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to evaluate variables of interest. 1794 studies from 782 females (44%) and 1012 males (56%) met inclusion criteria. Females were significantly older than males at time of first diagnosis (79 versus 75, p < 0.001). Females were significantly less likely to be evaluated by the TAVR clinic or a surgeon, and ultimately less likely to receive an AVR (Table 1). Females were significantly more likely to be rejected for TAVR on the basis of older age (OR 0.23 (0.07, 0.59)), multiple comorbid conditions (OR 0.68 (0.47, 0.97)), and frailty (OR 0.23 (0.07, 0.59)). Females were significantly more likely to be rejected for SAVR on the basis of frailty (OR 0.66 (0.46, 0.94)). Females also had significantly higher rates of cardiovascular outcomes compared to males. This included higher rates of mortality (60.2% versus 51.1%, p-value < 0.001), higher rates of 1-year hospitalization from time of diagnosis (42.0% versus 35.8%, p-value 0.007), and higher rates of 1-year heart failure hospitalization from time of diagnosis (22.4% versus 17.53%, p-value 0.012). CONCLUSION: Our data suggests the presence of significant sex-based discrepancies in the management of AS. Females are diagnosed later in life. They are less likely to be evaluated for valve replacement (both TAVR and SAVR), and upon evaluation, they are ultimately less likely to receive intervention due to their older age, frailty, and multimorbid conditions. Further research is warranted for more effective identification and follow up of aortic stenosis as well as timely referral for AVR, where appropriate, especially of females. [Formula presented]

AB  - Background: Previous studies have reported sex differences in pre-procedural imaging characteristics of patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) evaluation. Whether these differences affect the outcome of computed tomography (CT)-guided or cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR)-guided TAVR has not been studied. Objectives: This analysis aimed to evaluate sex-based differences in imaging findings and outcomes in patients undergoing TAVR for severe aortic valve stenosis. Methods: This was a secondary analysis of the TAVR-CMR trial, a randomized clinical trial comparing TAVR planning by CT or CMR. Outcomes (based on the Valve Academic Research Consortium (VARC)-2 definition) with each imaging strategy were compared according to sex. Results: Of 380 patient randomized into the TAVR-CMR trial, 194 (51.1%) were female and 186 (48.9%) were male. Of these, 267 patients eventually underwent TAVR (133 women (49.8%) and 134 men (50.2%), p=0.457). Imaging findings differed between the sexes for both imaging modalities. The comparison between CT and CMR to assess the access route and landing zone showed no difference in both women and men (all p>0.05). Implantation success was not significantly different between imaging strategies for both women (84.7% (CT group) vs. 93.2% (CMR group), p=0.11) and men (95.7% (CT group) vs. 93.8% (CMR group), p=0.61). All-cause mortality at 6 months was not significantly different between imaging strategies for both women (10.2% (CT group) vs. 8.1% (CMR group), p=0.68) and men (4.3% (CT group) vs. 9.4% (CMR group), p=0.24). Conclusions: This secondary analysis has confirmed sex-related differences in pre-procedural imaging characteristics, with no influence of the imaging modality used. Similar outcomes were observed in both female and male patients when the TAVR was guided by either a CMR or a CT scan.

AB  - Background: Left ventricular (LV) dilatation is a strong indicator of adverse outcome in patients with aortic regurgitation (AR). Accordingly, current guidelines recommend the use of LV end-systolic diameter index (LVESDi) as one of the criteria to trigger aortic valve surgery (AVS) in patients with severe AR, but with the same threshold regardless of gender. Purpose: To assess sex differences in LV remodeling using both volumetric and linear measurements in a large cohort of patients with significant AR (moderate or greater) and to investigate their prognostic implications. Methods: A total of 1070 patients (56 ± 18 years, 691 men) were included. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. Results: Women presented with older age (58 ± 19 vs. 55 ± 17, p=0.023) and more advanced heart failure (HF) symptoms than men (NYHA class III-IV 12% vs. 9%, p=0.017). Men showed significantly larger LVESDi (21 ± 5 vs. 20 ± 5 mm/m2, p=0.013) and LV end-systolic volume index (LVESVi 37 ± 28 vs. 26 ± 17 ml/m2 p<0.001). During a median follow-up of 89 (IQR, 54-132) months, 168 patients died. Women had lower survival rates at 3, 5, and 10 years of follow-up compared to men (92% vs. 94.3%; 85% vs. 89.7% and 75.3% vs. 84.1%, p=0.005) (Figure 1). Spline curve analysis revealed that the threshold of LVESDi associated with an increased risk of mortality was 20 mm/m2 for both sexes. In turn, the threshold for LVESVi was 40 ml/m2 for women and 45 ml/m2 for men. Univariable Cox regression models were constructed separately for men and women. The variables associated with all-cause mortality were age, NYHA class III-IV, and AVS as time-dependent covariate in women, and age, diabetes, AVS as time-dependent covariate, and LAVI (left atrial volume index) in men. These parameters were used as a basal multivariable Cox regression model on top of which LVESDi >20 mm/m2 (Model 1), LVESVi >40 ml/m2 for women and 45 ml/m2 for men (Model 2) were added (Table 1A). LVESVi >40 ml/m2 was not a significant univariate predictor in men. In women, LVESDi >20 mm/m2 (HR: 2.046, 95%CI 1.244-3.419; p=0.006) and LVESVi >40 ml/m2 (HR 1.758, CI 1.095-2.825; p=0.020) showed an independent association with all-cause mortality among other factors (Table 1A). In men, death was independently associated with LVESDi >20 mm/m2 (HR 1.979, 95%CI 1.255-3.121; p=0.003) and LVESVi >45 ml/m2 (HR 2.388, 1.522-3.746; p<0.001), among other factors (Table 1A). Moreover, when added to a basal model that included clinical and echocardiographic variables associated with prognosis, LV dilatation based on volumetric LV enlargement resulted in a greater discriminatory power for both genders (Table 1B). Conclusion: Men and women have a similar LVESDi threshold of 20 mm/m2, which is associated with an increased risk of death. However, their respective cut-off values for LVESVi differ, with the optimal threshold for women being 40 ml/m2 and for men 45 ml/m2. (Figure Presented).

AB  - Background: Aortic stenosis (AS) is the most common valvular heart disease in developed countries. Sex differences have been described in AS pathophysiology and left ventricular (LV) remodelling, as well as clinical presentation and response to therapies (1). However, sex differences in LV function parameters, namely global longitudinal strain (GLS), have been scarcely explored so far. Purpose: To investigate sex differences, taking into account GLS, in patients with severe AS referred to surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR). Methods: The study population was from a single centre, prospective registry of patients with severe native valve AS who were referred for SAVR between June 2020 to October 2022. Severe AS was defined by standard guideline criteria (2). All patients underwent an echocardiogram immediately before and at least 3 months after surgery. Results: Table 1 recapitulates sex differences in our population (n=119, 43% women). No differences in age or cardiovascular (CV) risk factors were noted. Clinical presentation and AS etiology were also similar. At baseline, women had lower EuroSCORE (p=0.039), creatinine (p <0.001), and haemoglobin levels (p=0.001). The echocardiogram showed a higher mean aortic valve gradient in women (Gmean, 62 vs. 50 mmHg, p=0.002). Women also had higher relative wall thickness (RWT, 0.49 vs. 0.42, p=0.037), despite lower LV mass index (124.9 vs. 136.6 g/m2, p=0.037). Regarding LV function, women showed higher EF (64% vs. 60%, p=0.002) and GLS (16.5% vs. 14.6%, p=0.006) values. This is partially explained by the higher prevalence of concomitant coronary artery disease (CAD) in men, more frequently subjected to a concomitant coronary artery bypass graft than women (CABG, 38% vs. 8%, p <0.001). Post-operative complications had similar rates in men and women. After a median follow-up of 16 (6-18) months, death from any cause (6.0% vs. 1.5%, p=0.186) and rehospitalization for CV causes (14.0% vs. 4.0%, p=0.055) tended to be more frequent among women. When considering patients with severe AS alone (n=89), women had higher Gmean (64 vs. 53 mmHg, p=0.035) and EF (65% vs. 62%, p=0.045) but similar GLS (16.9% vs. 16.6%, p=0.230) as compared to men (Figure 2). At follow-up, EF and GLS failed to improve in both sexes and no differences were noted between women and men (EF 60% vs. 60%, p=0.476; GLS 15.9% vs. 16.0%, p=0.976). Conclusions: In a population of all-comers patients with severe AS undergoing SAVR, women showed higher Gmean, EF, and GLS values. This is partially due to the higher prevalence of a concomitant CAD in men. When considering patients with AS alone, women still had higher EF and Gmean than men, despite a similar GLS. Future larger prospective studies with longer follow-up are needed in order to further characterize such differences and correlate them with specific outcomes. (Figure Presented).

AB  - This state-of-the-art review aimed to synthesize evidence from various sex-stratified studies on aortic stenosis (AS), focusing on the difference in clinical presentation, anatomical characteristics, pathophysiology, and management of AS. In comparison to men, women with AS are present at later stages, are older, more symptomatic, frailer, and exhibit higher operative risk [Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) score]. Women tend to have smaller aortic valve (AV) areas and left ventricular (LV) outflow tract, leading to lower stroke volumes (SVs) than men and have a higher prevalence of paradoxical, low-flow, low-gradient AS. In women, chronic pressure overload due to AS results in concentric LV remodelling and hypertrophy, characterized by reduced LV cavities, higher filling pressures, lower wall stress, and more diastolic dysfunction. Conversely, men exhibit more dilated eccentric LV remodelling and hypertrophy. AVs in women are less calcified but more fibrotic. Moreover, women are often underdiagnosed, have severity underestimated, and experience delays or receive fewer referrals for AV replacement (AVR). However, women tend to benefit from transcatheter AVR (TAVR) with a long-term survival advantage over men, although the incidence of vascular complications and bleeding events in 30 days after TAVR is higher in women. Surgical AVR (SAVR) in women has high operative risk, is technically demanding and has poorer outcomes with increased mortality at 30 days compared to men. According to the STS score and EuroSCORE, the female sex itself is considered a risk factor for SAVR. Therefore, addressing sex-related disparities in AS and increasing awareness among physicians promises improved diagnosis and treatment, facilitating equitable care and the development of sex-specific personalized medicine.

AB  - Purpose of Review: As the presence of valvular heart disease increases with age and women have a longer life-expectancy than men, gender disparities for patients with valvular heart disease (VHD) are exacerbated in the aging population. In this article, we review the differences in presentation, pathophysiology, treatment, and outcomes between men and women with VHD and examine available data as to how these differences may impact the aging population. Recent Findings: Available data demonstrate significant gender-related differences in clinical presentation, treatment, and outcomes for patients with valvular heart disease (VHD). It is also well-established that men and women exhibit different risk profiles which leads to a significant impact on treatment outcomes. Women tend to be under-referred, often present for delayed treatment, and are under-represented in most large-scale clinical trials. Summary: Valvular heart disease is a major contributor to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in women—the leading cause of mortality in women worldwide. Many studies demonstrate anatomic and pathophysiologic gender differences in the structure and function of aortic and mitral valve disease processes. These differences are not incorporated in current ACC/AHA guidelines for diagnosis and management of aortic and mitral disease, which leads to the under-diagnosis and undertreatment of VHD in women. As a result, women present later in the disease process and experience increased risk for VHD-related events and increased morbidity and mortality with surgical and percutaneous interventions. These sex specific differences are likely to be amplified in older adults, as women compose a greater proportion of the aging population with increased life expectancy compared to men.

AB  - Background: Despite comprising almost half of all patients undergoing valvular repair, data on transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) in patients with bicuspid aortic stenosis (BAS) are limited. Objective: We aimed to evaluate whether there are any sex differences in trends and outcomes of TAVR in this population. Methods: We utilized the National Inpatient Sample from 2012 to 2020 to identify admissions with BAS who underwent TAVR and analyzed trends and outcomes. Our primary outcome was in-hospital mortality and secondary outcomes were in-hospital complications. We used two models to adjust for demographics (A) and interventions (B). Results: Between 2012 to 2020, there were 76,540 hospitalizations for BAS patients who underwent AVR, among which 6,010 (7.9 %) underwent TAVR. There was an overall increasing trend in number of TAVR cases with a decreasing trend in mortality (2013: 8.7 %, 2020: 1.3 %). TAVR was performed more in males (61.1% vs 38.9 %). Despite the worse baseline characteristics in males, in-hospital mortality (2.4% vs. 1.5 %; OR: 1.584; 95 % CI: 0.621–4.038; p = 0.335) and secondary outcomes were similar across both sexes, even after adjusting for demographics and interventions. Conclusion: TAVR in BAS has grown rapidly in the last decade. Males comprised the majority and had more comorbidities, but mortality and complications were similar in both sexes. Despite the increasing number of cases, a decreasing trend in mortality was observed for both sexes ultimately approaching that of SAVR, suggesting that TAVR may be a safe alternative among eligible males and females with bicuspid AS.

AB  - Background: The impact of sex on outcomes following surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) remains unclear. It has been proposed that females experience inferior outcomes, but this has yet to be conclusively established, particularly in the long term. The objective of this study is to identify discrepancies in postoperative outcomes between males and females following SAVR to better inform consideration for surgical intervention. Method: We retrospectively reviewed the outcomes of 4,927 patients who underwent SAVR from 2004 to 2018 at our centre. In total, 531 propensity-matched males and females were included in the final analysis. The primary outcome was mortality at any point during the follow-up period. Secondary outcomes included various measures of postoperative morbidity. Follow-up duration was 15 years. Results: In SAVR all-comers, females experienced inferior short-term mortality, but equivalent mid-term and long-term mortality. Rates of mediastinal bleeding, sternal wound infections, sepsis, heart failure, and pacemaker insertion were all equivalent between the sexes; however, males experienced a higher rate of acute kidney injury and readmission for stroke at the longest follow-up while females experienced a longer intensive care unit and hospital length of stay. In a sub-analysis of isolated SAVR, males and females experienced equivalent early, mid, and late mortality. Of note, a trend towards increased aortic valve reoperation was noted in females at the longest follow-up. Conclusions: Males and females experience equivalent long-term mortality following isolated SAVR. Sex is not an independent risk factor of poor outcomes post-SAVR; however, the increased preoperative risk profile of females requires diligent consideration.

AB  - Introduction: Women are generally underrepresented in trials focusing on aortic aneurysm. Nevertheless, sex-related differences have recently emerged from several studies and registries. The aim of this research was to assess whether sex-related anatomical disparities existed in fenestrated and branched aortic repair candidates and whether these discrepancies could influence endovascular repair outcomes. Methods: Data from all consecutive patients treated during the 2008–2019 period within the Italian Multicenter fenestrated or branched endovascular aortic repair (F/BEVAR) Registry were included in the present study. Propensity matching was performed using a logistic regression model adjusted for demographic data and comorbidities to obtain comparable male and female samples. The selection model led to a final study population of 176 patients (88 women and 88 men) among the total initial cohort of 596. Study endpoints were technical and clinical success, overall survival, aneurysm-related death, and reintervention rates evaluated at 30 days and during follow-up. Results: Twenty-eight patients (15.9%) received urgent/emergent repair. In most of the cases (71.6%), women received treatment for extensive thoracoabdominal pathology (Crawford type I, II, or III aneurysm rather than type IV or juxta-pararenal) versus 46.6% of men (p=0.001). Female patients presented with more challenging iliac accesses with at least one side considered hostile in 27.3% of the cases (vs 13.6% in male patients, p=0.039). Finally, women had significantly smaller visceral vessels. Women had significantly worse operative outcomes, with an 86.2% technical success rate versus 96.6% in the male population (p=0.016). No differences were recorded in terms of 30-day reinterventions between men and women. The 5-year estimate of freedom from late reintervention, according to Kaplan-Meier analysis, was 85.6% in men versus 81.6% in women (p=ns). No aneurysm-related death was recorded during follow-up (median observational time, 23 months [interquartile range, 7–45 months]). Conclusion: Women presented a significantly higher incidence of thoracoabdominal aneurysms, smaller visceral vessels, and more complex iliofemoral accesses, resulting in a significantly lower technical success after F/BEVAR. Further studies assessing sex-related differences are needed to properly determine the impact on outcomes and stratify procedural risks. Clinical Impact: Women are generally underrepresented in trials focusing on aortic aneurysms. Aiming to assess whether sex may affect outcomes after a complex endovascular aortic repair, a propensity score selection was applied to a total population of 596 patients receiving F/BEVAR aortic repair with the Cook platform, matching each treated female patient with a corresponding male patient. Women presented more frequently a thoracoabdominal aneurysm extent, smaller visceral vessels, and complex iliofemoral accesses, resulting in significantly worse operative outcomes, with an 86.2% technical success versus 96.6% (p=0.016). No differences were recorded in terms of short-term and mid-term reinterventions. According to these results, careful and critical assessment should be posed in case of female patients receiving complex aortic repair, especially regarding preoperative anatomical evaluation and clinical selection with appropriate surgical risk stratification.

AB  - Background: Current literature suggests that women undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) are at higher risk for major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), including all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, and/or cerebrovascular accident. This study further investigates the relationship of gender with mortality, MACE, onset of conduction abnormalities, congestive heart failure exacerbation, and bleeding events among TAVR patients. Methods: A retrospective study of TAVR patients at a major academic medical institution in Chicago, Illinois from 3/2018 and 12/2022 was conducted. The prevalence of different cardiac risk factors (hypertension, pulmonary hypertension, smoking history, alcohol use, coronary artery disease) was analyzed. Primary outcomes of interest included MACE, the onset of conduction abnormalities, congestive heart failure exacerbation, and bleeding events at 6 and 12 months post-TAVR. Rehospitalization events were analyzed at 30 days. T-tests and Chi-square tests were used to analyze continuous and categorical variables, respectively. Results: Of the 228 patients analyzed, the mean age was 76 ± 10 years old, with 27% of patients being female. Among TAVR patients, there was an increased prevalence of known cardiac risk factors among men, including a history of smoking, pulmonary hypertension, alcohol use, and coronary artery disease. However, there were no statistically significant differences in the rates of MACE, congestive heart failure exacerbation, post-TAVR conduction abnormalities, and bleeding events at both 6 and 12 months between genders. There was also no statistically significant difference in the rates of rehospitalization within 30 days between male and female patients following TAVR. Conclusion: Despite men having a higher prevalence of cardiac risk factors, we did not observe any statistically significant differences in clinical outcomes between genders among TAVR patients. This study helps to dispel the notion that women tend to experience worse outcomes compared to men after TAVR.

AB  - Background: Longer waiting times for transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) have been documented among women compared to men within the public healthcare sector. This study aims to explore whether a gender disparity in wait times exists within the private healthcare sector and whether this affects short-term outcomes. Methods: All patients from January 2018 to July 2022 who underwent TAVI at a tertiary private hospital in Melbourne were prospectively included into a database, which was then analysed for this study. Patients were analysed according to gender. The primary outcome was waiting time. Secondary outcomes included immediate, 30-day and 12-month mortality and morbidity. Results: A total of 624 patients (254 women and 370 men) were included in the study. Analysis of baseline characteristics found average age across genders was 82.8±6.5 years, and that women had higher pressure gradients and worse symptomology at presentation. There was no statistically significant difference in waiting times between genders, with the total median waiting time for women being 61.5 [32.3–98.0] days, and men 55.0 [31.0–102.5] days (p=0.86), with both distributions being positively skewed. Increased waiting times were not associated with higher mortality or rehospitalisation rates but were associated with poorer mobility and greater pain and discomfort for females at 12-month follow-up (p=0.01). Conclusion: We found no discernible gender difference for TAVI wait times, a key distinction from the public sector. Despite this, women were shown to have worse quality of life at 12-months post-procedure when compared to men.

AB  - Objective To compare long-term cardiovascular (CV) outcomes between men and women with aortic stenosis (AS) undergoing aortic valve replacement (AVR) by the type of valve implant. Methods The study population consisted of 14 123 non-selected patients with AS undergoing first-time AVR and included in the Swedish Web system for Enhancement and Development of Evidence-based care in Heart disease Evaluated According to Recommended Therapies (SWEDEHEART) registry during 2008–2016. Comparisons were made between men and women and type of valve implant (ie, surgical implantation with a mechanical (mSAVR) (n=1 966) or biological valve (bioSAVR) (n=9 801)) or by a transcatheter approach (TAVR) (n=2 356). Outcomes included all-cause mortality, ischaemic stroke, major bleeding, thromboembolic events, heart failure and myocardial infarction, continuously adjusted for significant comorbidities and medical treatment. Results In the mSAVR cohort, there were no significant sex differences in any CV events. In the bioSAVR cohort, a higher risk of death (HR: 1.14; 95% CI: 1.04 to 1.26, p=0.007) and major bleeding (HR: 1.41; 95% CI: 1.18 to 1.69, p<0.001) was observed in men. In the TAVR cohort, men suffered a higher risk of death (HR: 1.24; 95% CI: 1.07 to 1.45, p=0.005), major bleeding (HR: 1.35; 95% CI: 1.00 to 1.82, p=0.022) and thromboembolism (HR: 1.35, 95% CI: 1.00 to 1.82, p=0.047). Conclusion No significant long-term difference in CV events was noted between men and women undergoing AVR with a mechanical aortic valve. In both the bioSAVR and TAVR cohort, mortality was higher in men who also had an increased incidence of several other CV events.

AB  - Behçet’s syndrome (BS) is a variant vasculitis that can involve multiple organs with inflammatory manifestations. This study aimed to provide a more comprehensive analysis of the clinical phenotypes and characteristics of BS patients. We enrolled 2792 BS patients referred from China nationwide to Huadong Hospital Affiliated to Fudan University from October 2012 to December 2022. Detailed assessments of demographic information, clinical manifestations, laboratory results, gastroscopy, and medical imaging were conducted. Cluster analysis was performed based on 13 variables to determine the clinical phenotypes, and each phenotype was characterized according to the features of BS patients. A total of 1834 BS patients were included, while 958 invalid patients were excluded. The median age at onset was 31 years (IQR, 24–40 years), and the median disease duration was 10 years (IQR, 5–15 years). Eight clusters were identified, including mucocutaneous (n = 655, 35.7%), gastrointestinal (n = 363, 19.8%), articular (n = 184, 10%), ocular (n = 223, 12.2%), cardiovascular (n = 119, 6.5%), neurological (n = 118, 6.4%), vascular (n = 114, 6.2%), and hematological phenotype (n = 58, 3.2%). Ocular (RR = 1.672 (95% CI, 1.327–2.106); P < 0.001), gastrointestinal (RR = = 1.194 (95% CI, 1.031–1.383); P = 0.018), cardiovascular (RR = = 2.582 (95% CI, 1.842–3.620); P < 0.001), and vascular (RR = = 2.288 (95% CI, 1.600–3.272); P < 0.001) involvement were more prevalent in male BS patients, while the hematological (RR = 0.528 (95% CI, 0.360–0.776); P = 0.001) involvement was more common among female patients. BS presents significant heterogeneity and gender differences. The eight phenotypes of BS patients we propose hold the potential to assist clinicians in devising more personalized treatment and follow-up strategies. (Table presented.)

AB  - In this narrative review, we investigate the essential role played by the computed tomography Aortic Valve Calcium Score (AVCS) in the cardiovascular diagnostic landscape, with a special focus on its implications for clinical practice and scientific research. Calcific aortic valve stenosis is the most prevalent type of aortic stenosis (AS) in industrialized countries, and due to the aging population, its prevalence is increasing. While transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) remains the gold standard, AVCS stands out as an essential complementary tool in evaluating patients with AS. The advantage of AVCS is its independence from flow; this allows for a more precise evaluation of patients with discordant findings in TTE. Further clinical applications of AVCS include in the assessment of patients before transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), as it helps in predicting outcomes and provides prognostic information post-TAVR. Additionally, we describe different AVCS thresholds regarding gender and the anatomical variations of the aortic valve. Finally, we discuss various scientific studies where AVCS was applied. As AVCS has some limitations, due to the pathophysiologies of AS extending beyond calcification and gender differences, scientists strive to validate contrast-enhanced AVCS. Furthermore, research on developing radiation-free methods of measuring calcium content is ongoing.

AB  - Calcific aortic stenosis (AS) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in high-income countries. AS presents sex-specific features impacting pathophysiology, outcomes, and management strategies. In women, AS often manifests with a high valvular fibrotic burden, small valvular annuli, concentric left ventricular (LV) remodeling/hypertrophy, and, frequently, supernormal LV ejection fraction coupled with diastolic dysfunction. Paradoxical low-flow low-gradient AS epitomizes these traits, posing significant challenges post-aortic valve replacement due to limited positive remodeling and significant risk of patient–prosthesis mismatch. Conversely, men present more commonly with LV dilatation and dysfunction, indicating the phenotype of classical low-flow low-gradient AS, i.e., with decreased LV ejection fraction. However, these distinctions have not been fully incorporated into guidelines for AS management. The only treatment for AS is aortic valve replacement; women are frequently referred late, leading to increased heart damage caused by AS. Therefore, it is important to reassess surgical planning and timing to minimize irreversible cardiac damage in women. The integrity and the consideration of sex differences in the management of AS is critical. Further research, including sufficient representation of women, is needed to investigate these differences and to develop individualized, sex-specific management strategies.

AB  - Background Despite its high prevalence, little is known about the effect of sex on the management and outcomes of aortic stenosis (AS). We sought to characterize the effect of sex on the clinical evaluation for and provision of aortic valve replacement (AVR), including surgical (SAVR) and transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), and subsequent morbidity and mortality outcomes. Methods A comprehensive chart review was conducted on all patients with a first diagnosis of severe aortic stenosis (AS) at Vancouver General and University of British Columbia Hospitals from 2012 to 2022. Exact chi-square and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to evaluate variables of interest. Results A total of 1794 studies met inclusion criteria, comprising 782 females (44%) and 1012 males (56%). Females were significantly older than males at the time of first diagnosis (79 versus 75 years, p<0.001). Females were significantly less likely to be evaluated by the TAVR clinic, cardiac surgeon, or to receive aortic valve intervention (p-value≤0.001). Females were significantly more likely to be rejected for TAVR due to older age (OR 0.23 (0.07, 0.59)), comorbid conditions (OR 0.68 (0.47, 0.97)), and frailty (OR 0.23 (0.07, 0.59)). Females were significantly more likely to be rejected for SAVR on the basis of frailty (OR 0.66 (0.46, 0.94)). Females also had significantly higher rates of 1-year mortality, hospitalization, and heart failure hospitalization compared to males (p-values < 0.05). Conclusion Our data suggest significant sex-based discrepancies in the management of AS. Females with severe AS are diagnosed later in life and are less likely to be evaluated for valve intervention. They are less likely to receive intervention due to older age, frailty, and multimorbid conditions. Further research is warranted for more effective identification and follow up of aortic stenosis as well as timely referral for AVR, where appropriate, especially of females.

AB  - Background: While females have been found to have a higher rate of procedural complications with transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) than males, the effect of valve choice has not been fully elucidated. This study aimed to investigate the impact of gender and choice of balloon or self-expanding valve on TAVI complications. Methods: Data from patients who received a TAVI in our institution from January 2016 to September 2021 were retrospectively analyzed. A total of 971 patients were included and divided into self-expanding valve (n = 315) and balloon-expandable valve (n = 656) groups. The endpoints were 30-day mortality, need for a new pacemaker, and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) which is defined as cardiac arrest, stroke, myocardial infarction, major bleeding, and unplanned vascular surgery/intervention. Results: There were more females in the self-expanding valve group than in the balloon-expandable valve group (64.1 % vs. 43.6 %: p < 0.0001). There is no significant difference in the prevalence of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, current smoker, hemodialysis, and the STS risk score between the 2 groups. Females had a higher rate of major adverse cardiovascular events (3.7 % in men vs. 6.8 % in women; p = 0.043), which was driven mostly by vascular complications. This difference was particularly observed in the self-expanding valve group (2.7 % in men vs. 9.4 % in women; p = 0.036). Conclusions: TAVI complications were more common in females than males, driven mostly by vascular complications. This difference was particularly observed in woman treated with a self-expanding valve. Particular attention should be given to access choices in females undergoing TAVI.

TI  - Anatomical variations and embryological basis of arch of aorta and aortic valve
AU  - Xaviour, R.

T2  - Anatomical Science International
AB  - Variations in the arch of the aorta and aortic valves among fetal, cadaveric, and post-mortem specimens present a spectrum of anatomical configurations, posing challenges in establishing a standard norm. While some variations hold surgical significance, many bear little functional consequence but provide insights into embryological origins. The aortic arch exhibits diverse branching patterns, including common trunks and different orders, relevant for endovascular surgeries. Meanwhile, malformations in the aortic valve, affecting the aorta, may lead to ischemia and cerebral infarction, warranting understanding of coexisting arch and valve anomalies to predict complications like aortic dissection. Studies in the Indian population mirror global variations, underscoring the need to explore embryological, clinical, and surgical implications for safer vascular surgeries involving the aortic arch and valves. The study’s objectives included examining branching patterns, diameters, and distances between arch branches and exploring aortic valve variations. Employing a cross-sectional design, the study was conducted across Anatomy, Forensic Medicine, and Obstetrics and Gynecology departments. A sample of 100, comprising cadavers, fetuses, and postmortem specimens, were gathered. Specimens ranged from 14 weeks of intrauterine life to 85 years, with intact thoracic cages as inclusion criteria. Methodology involved dissection, specimen fixation, and macroscopic examination for variations and morphological parameters. Results showed aortic diameter increase with age, with significant gender differences. A statistically significant association between arch variations and anomalous valves was observed, suggesting mutual predictability. Individuals with valve anomalies should undergo comprehensive cardiology evaluation to avert complications like aortic dissection during endovascular surgeries. While atheromatous plaques were prevalent in younger groups, their frequency rose with age, necessitating vigilant vascular monitoring. Careful handling during surgeries is paramount, given potential adverse outcomes resulting from variations. Overall, the study underscores the importance of comprehensive anatomical understanding in clinical contexts, guiding effective management strategies and ensuring patient safety in vascular surgeries.

AB  - Background: Cardiac damage caused by aortic stenosis (AS) can be categorized into stages, which are associated with a progressively increasing risk of death after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Objectives: The authors investigated sex-related differences in cardiac damage among patients with symptomatic AS and the prognostic value of cardiac damage classification in women and men undergoing TAVR. Methods: In a prospective registry, pre-TAVR echocardiograms were used to categorize patients into 5 stages of cardiac damage caused by AS. Differences in the extent of cardiac damage were compared according to sex, and its implications on clinical outcomes after TAVR were explored. Results: Among 2,026 patients undergoing TAVR between August 2007 and June 2022 (995 [49.1%] women and 1,031 [50.9%] men), we observed sex-specific differences in the pattern of cardiac damage (women vs men; stage 0: 2.6% vs 3.1%, stage 1: 13.4% vs 10.1%, stage 2: 37.1% vs 39.5%, stage 3: 27.5% vs 15.6%, and stage 4: 19.4% vs 31.7%). There was a stepwise increase in 5-year all-cause mortality according to stage in women (HRadjusted: 1.43; 95% CI: 1.28-1.60, for linear trend) and men (HRadjusted: 1.26; 95% CI: 1.14-1.38, for linear trend). Female sex was associated with a lower 5-year mortality in early stages (stage 0, 1, or 2) but not in advanced stages (stage 3 or 4). Conclusions: The pattern of cardiac damage secondary to AS differed by sex. In early stages of cardiac damage, women had a lower 5-year mortality than men, whereas in more advanced stages, mortality was comparable between sexes. (SwissTAVI Registry; NCT01368250)

AB  - Importance: Homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) is a rare genetic condition characterized by extremely increased low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels and premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) is more common than HoFH, and women with HeFH are diagnosed later and undertreated compared to men; it is unknown whether these sex differences also apply to HoFH. Objective: To investigate sex differences in age at diagnosis, risk factors, lipid-lowering treatment, and ASCVD morbidity and mortality in patients with HoFH. Design, Setting, and Participants: Sex-specific analyses for this retrospective cohort study were performed using data from the HoFH International Clinical Collaborators (HICC) registry, the largest global dataset of patients with HoFH, spanning 88 institutions across 38 countries. Patients with HoFH who were alive during or after 2010 were eligible for inclusion. Data entry occurred between February 2016 and December 2020. Data were analyzed from June 2022 to June 2023. Main Outcomes and Measures: Comparison between women and men with HoFH regarding age at diagnosis, presence of risk factors, lipid-lowering treatment, prevalence, and onset and incidence of ASCVD morbidity (myocardial infarction [MI], aortic stenosis, and combined ASCVD outcomes) and mortality. Results: Data from 389 women and 362 men with HoFH from 38 countries were included. Women and men had similar age at diagnosis (median [IQR], 13 [6-26] years vs 11 [5-27] years, respectively), untreated LDL cholesterol levels (mean [SD], 579 [203] vs 596 [186] mg/dL, respectively), and cardiovascular risk factor prevalence, except smoking (38 of 266 women [14.3%] vs 59 of 217 men [27.2%], respectively). Prevalence of MI was lower in women (31 of 389 [8.0%]) than men (59 of 362 [16.3%]), but age at first MI was similar (mean [SD], 39 [13] years in women vs 38 [13] years in men). Treated LDL cholesterol levels and lipid-lowering therapy were similar in both sexes, in particular statins (248 of 276 women [89.9%] vs 235 of 258 men [91.1%]) and lipoprotein apheresis (115 of 317 women [36.3%] vs 118 of 304 men [38.8%]). Sixteen years after HoFH diagnosis, women had statistically significant lower cumulative incidence of MI (5.0% in women vs 13.7% in men; subdistribution hazard ratio [SHR], 0.37; 95% CI, 0.21-0.66) and nonsignificantly lower all-cause mortality (3.0% in women vs 4.1% in men; HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.40-1.45) and cardiovascular mortality (2.6% in women vs 4.1% in men; SHR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.44-1.75). Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study of individuals with known HoFH, MI was higher in men compared with women yet age at diagnosis and at first ASCVD event were similar. These findings suggest that early diagnosis and treatment are important in attenuating the excessive cardiovascular risk in both sexes..

AB  - Background Women with chronic aortic regurgitation (AR) who undergo surgery have higher mortality compared to men. Current guidelines endorse sex agnostic left ventricular dimensions, for surgical referral. Recent studies have demonstrated important sex differences in remodeling. We sought to assess sex-specific thresholds of remodeling to predict adverse outcomes. Methods We conducted a multicenter retrospective cohort study (SCMR Registry), involving 4 U.S. institutions. Patients with aortic regurgitant fraction ≥ 20% by CMR or echocardiography were included. Surgery was defined as AV replacement, repair, or valve-sparing root replacement. The primary outcome was the composite of heart failure hospitalization and all-cause death. Results The cohort included 825 patients (185, 22.4% women), mean age 55 +/- 17 years. When adjusted for age, number of leaflets, coronary artery disease, and hypertension, there was a two-way interaction observed for normalized LV end-systolic volume and gender in both the surgical and non-surgical groups (p-value = 0.018). An interaction was also noted for normalized LV end-systolic diameter and gender (p-value 0.039) (See Figure 1). LV diastolic parameters were not statistically significant. [Formula presented] Conclusion Women with chronic AR experienced increased adverse outcomes with smaller LVESVi and LVESDi. Sex specific treatment guidelines are needed to optimize outcomes in women with chronic AR.

AB  - Background The 2020 ACC/AHA Guideline for the Management of Patients with Valvular Heart Disease recommends mechanical valve prostheses for patients <50 years but bioprosthetic valves for women of childbearing age. We aimed to examine sex differences in choice of valve prosthesis in young adults and sought to understand whether pregnancy planning was a factor in women. Methods Retrospective study of adults 18-45 years who underwent mitral [MVR] or aortic valve replacement [AVR] from 2002—2022. Electronic medical records were reviewed to examine family planning preferences prior to valve surgery. Results Of 657 patients, 237 (36%) were women, 69% underwent AVR and 31% MVR. In total, 58% of valve replacements were mechanical and 42% bioprosthetic. A greater proportion of women <35 years underwent bioprosthetic valve replacement compared to men (45 vs 33%, p=0.02) but for those ≥ 35 years, bioprosthetic valve replacements were more prevalent in men (Figure 1). Of the women, 84% had a documented provider discussion regarding valve choice. In those <35 years who underwent bioprosthetic AVR, desire for pregnancy was the main consideration in 23/32 (72%) as opposed to 5/18 (28%) for those who had bioprosthetic MVR (p = 0.004). Conclusion Bioprosthetic valve replacement was more common in women in their younger childbearing years. Future pregnancy was a main consideration for AVR but less so for MVR. Studies on long-term consequences of valve choice in early adulthood are needed. [Formula presented]

AB  - Background Aortic valve disease is common in adults with coarctation of aorta (COA). However, there are no systematic comparative analyses of the clinical course of aortic valve disease between men and women in this population. The purpose of this study was to compare cardiac remodeling, onset of symptoms, and incidence of aortic valve replacement (AVR) between men and women. Methods Retrospective study of adults with repaired COA and ≥moderate aortic stenosis and/or aortic regurgitation. Cardiac remodeling (left ventricular [LV], left atrial [LA], right ventricular [RV], and right atrial structure and function) and symptomatic/functional class were determined at baseline encounter. Development of new-onset symptoms and incidence of AVR were ascertained from baseline to last encounter. Results We identified 214 patients (121 [57%] men, 93 [43%] women). Although both groups had similar aortic valve gradient, aortic valve area indexed to body surface area, AR severity, and functional status at baseline, women had more LV concentric hypertrophy and remodeling, LA hypertension and dysfunction, elevated RV systolic pressure, and RV systolic dysfunction. Of 151 patients without symptoms at baseline,102 (72%) developed symptoms. Female sex was independently associated with new-onset symptoms (adjusted hazard ratio 1.14, [1.05-1.23]). Of 214 patients, 191 (89%) underwent AVR. Female sex was not associated with AVR on multivariable analysis. However, LV concentric hypertrophy and remodeling (both of which were more common in women) were associated with newonset symptoms and AVR. Conclusion Women had more advanced cardiac remodeling and rapid onset of symptoms, but a similar risk of AVR compared to men.

AB  - Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is a well-established procedure using a catheter-introduced valve prosthesis for patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS). This retrospective study investigated sex-related differences in pre- and post-TAVR clinical and hemodynamic outcomes and analyzed data of the first 100 cases at Kaohsiung Medical University Chung-Ho Memorial Hospital (KMUH) between December 2013 and December 2021. Baseline characteristics, procedural outcomes, mortality rates, and echocardiographic parameters were analyzed and compared between sexes. Among the 100 patients, male (46%) and female (54%) were of similar age (mean age, male 86.0 years vs. female 84.5 years) and of the same severity of AS (mean pressure gradient, male 47.5 mmHg vs. female 45.7 mmHg) at the time receiving the TAVR procedure. Women had smaller aortic valve areas calculated by continuity equation (0.8 ± 0.3 cm2 vs. 0.7 ± 0.2 cm2, p < 0.001). In addition, women had better left ventricle ejection fraction (59.6 ± 14.0% vs. men 54.7 ± 17.2%, p < 0.01). In the post-TAVR follow-up, regression of left ventricle mass and dimension was better in women than in men. None of the patient died within 30 days after the procedure, and women tended to have a more favorable survival than men (2-year mortality and overall mortality rate in 8.3 year, women 9.1% and 22.2% vs. men 22.2% and 34.8%; p = 0.6385 and 0.1277, respectively). In conclusion, the sex-based difference in post-TAVR regression of LV remodeling suggests a need for sex-based evaluation for patients with severe AS and their post TAVR follow-up.

AB  - Background: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is a reasonable therapeutic approach among patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis irrespective of surgical risk. Data regarding sex-specific differences in the outcomes with newer generation valves are limited. Methods: Electronic databases were searched for studies assessing sex differences in the outcomes of patients undergoing TAVR with newer generation valves (SAPIEN 3 or Evolut). Random effects model was constructed for summary estimates. Results: Four observational studies with 4522 patients (44.8% women) were included in the meta-analysis. Women were older and had a lower prevalence of coronary artery disease and mean EuroScore. Women had a higher incidence of short-term mortality (up to 30 days) (risk ratio [RR]: 1.60, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.14–2.25), but no difference in 1-year mortality (RR: 0.92, 95% CI: 0.72–1.17). There was no significant difference in the incidence of major bleeding (RR: 1.16, 95% CI: 0.86–1.57), permanent pacemaker (PPM) (RR: 0.80, 95% CI: 0.62–1.04), or disabling stroke (RR: 1.16, 95% CI: 0.54–2.45). Conclusion: In this meta-analysis, we found that women undergoing TAVR with newer-generation devices were older but had a lower prevalence of comorbidities. Women had a higher incidence of short-term mortality but no difference in the 1-year mortality, bleeding, PPM, or stroke compared with men. Future studies are required to confirm these findings.

AB  - Background: Mitral valve (MV) disease is the most common form of valvular heart disease. Findings that indicate women have a higher risk for unfavorable outcomes than men remain controversial. This study aimed to determine the sex-based differences in epidemiological distributions and outcomes of surgery for MV disease. Methods and Results: Overall, 18,572 patients (45.3% women) who underwent MV surgery between 2001 and 2018 were included. Outcomes included in-hospital death and all-cause mortality during follow up. Subgroup analysis was conducted across different etiologies, including infective endocarditis (IE), degenerative, ischemic, and rheumatic mitral pathology. The overall MV repair rate was lower in women than in men (20.5% vs. 30.6%). After matching, 6,362 pairs (woman: man=1: 1) of patients were analyzed. Women had a slightly higher risk for in-hospital death than men (10.8% vs. 9.8%; odds ratio [OR]: 1.11, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.99–1.24; P=0.075). Women tended to have a higher incidence of de novo dialysis (9.8% vs. 8.6%; P=0.022) and longer intensive care unit stay (8 days vs. 7.1 days; P<0.001). Women with IE had poorer in-hospital outcomes than men; however, there were no sex differences in terms of all-cause mortality. Conclusions: Sex-based differences of MV intervention still persist. Although long-term outcomes were comparable between sexes, women, especially those with IE, had worse perioperative outcomes than men.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiac surgery for infective endocarditis (IE) is associated with significant hospital mortality, and female sex may be associated with worse outcomes. However, the impact of sex on the presenting characteristics, management, and outcomes of patients operated on for acute infective endocarditis (IE) has not been adequately studied. OBJECTIVES: The goal of our study was to analyse differences in management and outcome of IE between women and men who undergo surgery. METHODS: Clinical data of 717 patients undergoing cardiac surgery for IE between December 2005 and December 2019 were prospectively collected. Sex-related postoperative outcomes including in-hospital mortality were recorded. Univariable and multivariable analyses were performed to identify potential sex-related determinant of in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: In all, 532 male patients (74.2%) and 185 female patients (25.8%) underwent surgery for IE. At baseline, women had more frequent mitral regurgitation with 63 patients (34.1%) than men with 135 patients (25.4%) (P ¼ 0.002). Female sex was associated with higher in-hospital mortality (23.2% versus 17.3%, P ¼ 0.049). However, multivariable analysis revealed age (P < 0.01), antibiotics < 7 days before surgery (P ¼ 0.01) and staphylococcal IE (P < 0.01) but not female sex (P ¼ 0.99) as independent determinants of hospital mortality. CONCLUSIONS: In this study of patients operated-on for IE, female sex was associated with more severe manifestations of IE and significantly higher in-hospital mortality. However, after multivariable analysis, initial presentation, but not sex, seemed to determine clinical outcomes.

AB  - Introduction: In the context of Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation(TAVI), females often present with higher Society of Thoracic Surgeons(STS) mortality score values. Paradoxically, however, they tend to exhibit greater survival post- TAVI compared to males. Previous literature has shown that body composition(BC) may affect prognosis in cardiometabolic diseases. Specifically, increased visceral adipose tissue(VAT) and decreased skeletal muscle(SM) have been associated with worse outcomes, whereas subcutaneous adipose tissue(SAT) has shown a protective role. Nevertheless, whether these factors specifically interact with outcomes in relation to gender in patients treated with TAVI is still unknow. Methods: Data of patients who underwent TAVI in 2010-2022 were collected. The areas of SM, VAT and SAT were measured from scans at the third lumbar vertebra of preoperative CT exams. Variables are expressed as median[25p-75p] or absolute number(%) and were compared by Mann-Whitney and Chi-square test as appropriate. Mortality analyses were performed through Kaplan-Meier curves with log rank test and Cox regression models. Results: We enrolled 168 consecutive patients, including 89(53.3%) females. The median age was 84[81-86] years. In comparison to males, females exhibited higher values of STS mortality score (4.2[3.1-6.3] vs. 3.5[2.4-5.4], p=0.021) and SAT (189[111-242] vs. 135[92-170] cm2, p=0.001), along with lower values of SM (92[81-106] vs. 129[115-144] cm2, p<0.0001) and VAT (116[48-197] vs. 210[118- 266] cm2, p<0.0001). Additional differences are detailed in Table 1. The overall 1-year mortality was 15.6%, with females exhibiting lower mortality rates compared to males (10.1% vs. 21.8%, OR=4.5, p=0.033), as illustrated in Figure 1. In the multivariate analysis, female sex emerged as an independent predictor of better survival after adjusting for the STS mortality score (HR=0.4, 95% CI 0.2-0.9, p=0.028). Conclusions: In our cohort, female patients experienced lower 1-year mortality after TAVI compared to males. As females showed less SM and VAT and more SAT, we hypothesize that the interplay between muscle and adipose tissue, along with hormonal, inflammatory, and metabolic mechanisms, may create a more favorable cardiovascular environment, counteracting the higher pre-procedural STS mortality score. A distinct pattern of BC appears to be protective in female patients undergoing TAVI, and its evaluation could help optimize gender-specific risk stratification.

AB  - Aim: To promote the implementation of right ventricular (RV) longitudinal strain in clinical practice, we sought to propose normal values for RV free wall (RVFWLS) and four-chamber longitudinal strain (RV4CLS) and investigate the association with clinical and echocardiographic parameters in participants from the general population. Methods and Results: Participants from the 5th Copenhagen City Heart Study (2011–2015)—a prospective cohort study—with available RV longitudinal strain measurements were included. RVFWLS and RV4CLS were assessed using two-dimensional speckle-tracking echocardiography. In total, 2951 participants were included. Amongst 1297 participants without cardiovascular disease or risk factors (median age 44, 63% female), mean values of RVFWLS and RV4CLS were − 26.7% ± 5.2 (95% prediction interval (PI) − 36.9, − 16.5) and − 21.7% ± 3.4 (95%PI − 28.4, − 15.0), respectively. Women had significantly higher absolute values of RVFWLS and RV4CLS than men (mean − 27.5 ± 5.5 vs. − 25.4 ± 4.5, p < 0.001 and − 22.3 ± 3.5 vs. − 20.6 ± 3.0, p < 0.001, respectively). Absolute values of RVFWLS but not RV4CLS decreased significantly with increasing age in unadjusted linear regression. Tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion, RV s’ and left ventricular global longitudinal strain were the most influential parameters associated with both RVFWLS and RV4CLS in multiple linear regression. Participants with cardiovascular disease (n = 1531) had a higher proportion of abnormal values of RVFWLS and RV4CLS compared to the healthy population (8% vs. 4%, p < 0.001 and 8% vs. 3%, p < 0.001, respectively). Conclusion: This study proposed normal age- and sex-based values of RVFWLS and RV4CLS in a healthy population sample and showed significant sex differences in both measurements across ages.

AB  - Background: Early studies on transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) outcomes showed that female sex was associated with better survival. With increased use of new-generation valves, the impact of sex on contemporary TAVR outcomes is less well known. Methods: Retrospective analysis using institutional National Cardiovascular Data Registry STS/ACC TVT data was performed on all patients undergoing TAVR at Yale New Haven Hospital from July 2012 to August 2019. New-generation valves were Evolut PRO, Evolut R, and SAPIEN 3. Old-generation valves were CoreValve, SAPIEN, and SAPIEN XT. Log-rank test and Kaplan-Meier curves were used to compare sex differences in survival up to 1 year after TAVR. Cox modeling was used to adjust for baseline and procedural characteristic differences. Results: 927 consecutive patients (41.4% women) underwent TAVR. Women were older (82.8 vs 80.6 years old; p < 0.001) with higher STS mortality scores compared with men (7.6% vs 6.4%; p < 0.001) despite lower prevalence of cardiovascular comorbidities including coronary artery disease, peripheral artery disease, and smoking. Most cases used transfemoral access (90.5%) and new-generation devices (72.3%). Women received smaller valves compared with men (20–26 mm: 78.0% vs 32.9%; 29–34 mm: 22.1% vs 67.1%; overall p < 0.0001). There were no statistically significant differences between sexes in both unadjusted and adjusted 1-year mortality. Conclusion: Our data show no significant difference in 1-year survival between sexes using primarily new generation valves. Further studies should reassess the impact of sex on TAVR outcomes and whether newer technologies like new valve design and sizes, and CT imaging may have eliminated sex-based disparities.

AB  - Background: Homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) is a rare, autosomal semi-dominant lipid metabolism disorder characterized by extremely high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels and premature cardiovascular disease. The objective of this study was to investigate sex-differences in the treatment and outcomes of patients with HoFH. Methods: We examined clinical characteristics, lipid-lowering therapy (LLT), and cardiovascular events using descriptive statistics of patients in the Canadian HoFH registry. Major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) were defined as the composite of cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and stroke. Sex differences between continuous and categorical variables were analyzed using Mann-Whitney U test and Fisher's Exact test, respectively. Results: This study included 48 patients (27 (56%) female). The median age at diagnosis in females was 14.0 (interquartile range (IQR) 9.0–30.0) and in males was 8.0 (IQR 2.0–23.0) (p = 0.07). Baseline clinical characteristics were comparable between both sexes. The median baseline LDL-C was 12.7 mmol/L (10.0–18.3) in females and 15.3 (10.5–20.0) in males (p = 0.51). Follow up LDL-C levels were 7.6 mmol/L (IQR 4.8–11.0) in females and 6.3 (IQR 4.6–7.5) in males (p = 0.1). Most patients were taking 3 or more LLTs, with comparable proportions in both sexes (p = 0.26). Apheresis was similar in both sexes, 14 (51.8%) vs. 10 (47.6%) (p = 0.2). Over a mean of 10 years of follow-up, MACE occurred in 3 females (11.1%) and 4 males (19.1%) (p = 0.2). Conclusion: Lipid levels and treatment were similar between sexes. MACE occurred in similar proportions between sexes, indicating that HoFH offsets the inherently lower cardiovascular risk in pre-menopausal females. Further investigation into sex-differences in HoFH in larger sample sizes is warranted.

AB  - Background: Left ventricular (LV) remodeling occurs in response to aortic regurgitation (AR). Current ACC/AHA guidelines for AR management are based on unilateral LV measurements and symptom presentation, though they were derived from studies with predominantly male populations. Previous evidence suggest that compared to males, females present with more symptoms, are referred to surgery less, and have worse post-operative outcomes. The aim of this study was to utilize gold-standard CMR evaluation to assess sex differences in LV remodeling between male and female patients with chronic AR referred for aortic valve surgery in the multicenter Society for Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance (SCMR) registry. Methods: This study leveraged the SCMR registry data from five US sites. Patients referred for CMR with aortic regurgitation fraction (ARF) ≥ 20% by CMR or echocardiography were included. Primary data included LV ejection fraction (LVEF), ARF, and the following parameters indexed to body surface area: LV end diastolic diameter (LVEDDi), LV end systolic diameter (LVESDi), LV end-diastolic volume (LVEDVi), LV end-systolic volume (LVESVi), LV cardiac output (LVCOi), LV mass (LVMi), and LV stroke volume (LVSVi). Patients were separated into post-CMR surgical and non-surgical intervention groups. Results: We included 773 patients in the analysis (597 males, 168 females), 411 of which had aortic valve surgery (293 males, 61 females). The baseline characteristics between surgical and nonsurgical patients by sex are outlined in Table 1. Females had similar NHYA HF class in both the surgical and non-surgical groups (p = 0.2272). Females, however, presented with more symptoms compared to males regardless of surgery status (Table 1, Figure 1). Males referred for surgery had a higher NYHA class than those not referred (p <0.0001). LV volume measurements, EF, and ARF differed between surgical and conservatively managed groups, regardless of sex (Table 1). Females undergoing cardiac surgery had significantly smaller LVESDi, LVEDVi, LVESVi, LVMi, LVCOi, LVSVi and ARF, despite more prevalent symptoms, compared to males undergoing surgery (Table 2). Females had a higher EF compared to males (p = 0.0003), though EF did not differ in females with or without surgical intervention (p = 0.3539). Conclusion: In this multicenter SCMR registry study, LVESDi, LV volumes, and ARF were significantly lower in females than males recommended for aortic surgery, despite higher prevalence of symptoms in women compared to men. Furthermore, women who were referred for aortic valve intervention demonstrated a higher NYHA class, suggesting delayed referral for aortic valve intervention. Our study further demonstrates the importance of sex-specific guidelines for surgical referral, and the impact of CMR to derive optimal sex specific remodeling criteria.

AB  - Background: Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) provides gold standard assessment of left ventricular remodeling (LVR) in response to chronic aortic regurgitation (AR). We sought to compare differences in LVR and AR severity in men vs women in the multicenter Society of Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance (SCMR) registry to evaluate sex-based differences in LVR. Methods: This study included SCMR registry data from five US sites. Patients with aortic regurgitation fraction (ARF) ≥ 20% by CMR or echocardiography were included. Subjects with the following were excluded: congenital heart disease, unrelated cardiomyopathies, prior cardiac surgery, severe kidney disease, aortic valve endocarditis, acute AR, pericardial disease, amyloidosis, sarcoidosis, implantable cardiac devices, and type A dissection. Primary data included LV ejection fraction (LVEF), ARF, and the following parameters indexed to body surface area: LV end diastolic diameter (LVEDDi), LV end systolic diameter (LVESDi), LV end-diastolic volume (LVEDVi), LV end-systolic volume (LVESVi), LV cardiac output (LVCOi), LV mass (LVMi), and LV stroke volume (LVSVi). Results: Among the 1035 adult patients (mean age 57 years, 231 [22%] females) included in this study, there were no significant differences in regard to body mass index, clinical comorbidities, with a slight trend towards older age in the women included in this study; there was higher prevalence of bicuspid aortic valves in men. See Table 1. When comparing left ventricular size, there were significant sex-differences in LV remodeling which are outlined in Table 2 and Figure 1. Females demonstrated significantly smaller LV volumes including LVEDVi (91.8 vs 110.2 ml/m 2, p<0.001) and LVESVi (37.5 vs 45.8ml/m2, p<0.001). Despite lower levels of regurgitation in females (mean ARF 28% vs 35%, p<0.001), women demonstrated significantly increased prevalence of symptoms. Furthermore, despite significantly smaller LV volumes, women demonstrated similar LV diameters compared to men, suggesting that women demonstrated more conical shaped ventricles. Males exhibited lower LVEF (58 vs 60.32%, p<0.001), however had greater LVCOi (4.1 vs 3.6 ml/m2, p<0.001) in the context of larger LV volumes. In both males and females, LV volumes including LVEDVi and LVESVi increased with rising ARF. Conclusion: CMR assessment demonstrates significant sex differences in LV remodeling and symptomatology in response to chronic AR. Our findings emphasize the need to further investigate the etiology and correlation of sex-based differences in LVR with increased symptoms in women. Furthermore, our findings suggest the need for sex specific therapeutic management strategies to optimize the management of chronic AR in women.

AB  - Background: Current literature suggests that women undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) are at higher risk for major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), including all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, and/or cerebrovascular accident. This study further investigates the relationship of gender with mortality, MACE, onset of conduction abnormalities, congestive heart failure exacerbation, and bleeding events among TAVR patients. Methods: A retrospective study of TAVR patients at a major academic medical institution in Chicago, Illinois from 3/2018 and 12/2022 was conducted. The prevalence of different cardiac risk factors (hypertension, pulmonary hypertension, smoking history, alcohol use, coronary artery disease) was analyzed. Primary outcomes of interest included MACE, the onset of conduction abnormalities, congestive heart failure exacerbation, and bleeding events at 6 and 12 months post-TAVR. Rehospitalization events were analyzed at 30 days. T-tests and Chi-square tests were used to analyze continuous and categorical variables, respectively. Results: Of the 228 patients analyzed, the mean age was 76 ± 10 years old, with 27% of patients being female. Among TAVR patients, there was an increased prevalence of known cardiac risk factors among men, including a history of smoking, pulmonary hypertension, alcohol use, and coronary artery disease. However, there were no statistically significant differences in the rates of MACE, congestive heart failure exacerbation, post-TAVR conduction abnormalities, and bleeding events at both 6 and 12 months between genders. There was also no statistically significant difference in the rates of rehospitalization within 30 days between male and female patients following TAVR. Conclusion: Despite men having a higher prevalence of cardiac risk factors, we did not observe any statistically significant differences in clinical outcomes between genders among TAVR patients. This study helps to dispel the notion that women tend to experience worse outcomes compared to men after TAVR.

AB  - The aorta plays a central role in the modulation of blood flow to supply end organs and to optimize the workload of the left ventricle. The constant interaction of the arterial wall with protective and deleterious circulating factors, and the cumulative exposure to ventriculoarterial pulsatile load, with its associated intimal-medial changes, are important players in the complex process of vascular aging. Vascular aging is also modulated by biomolecular processes such as oxidative stress, genomic instability, and cellular senescence. Concomitantly with well-established cardiometabolic and sex-specific risk factors and environmental stressors, arterial stiffness is associated with cardiovascular disease, which remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in women worldwide. Sexual dimorphisms in aortic health and disease are increasingly recognized and explain—at least in part—some of the observable sex differences in cardiovascular disease, which will be explored in this review. Specifically, we will discuss how biological sex affects arterial health and vascular aging and the implications this has for development of certain cardiovascular diseases uniquely or predominantly affecting women. We will then expand on sex differences in thoracic and abdominal aortic aneurysms, with special considerations for aortopathies in pregnancy.

AB  - Background: While pulmonary hypertension (PH) in patients with severe aortic valve stenosis (AS) is associated with increased mortality after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), there is limited data on gender differences in the effects on long-term survival. Objective: The aim of this retrospective, multicenter study was to investigate the prognostic impact of pre-interventional PH on survival of TAVR patients with respect to gender. Methods: 303 patients undergoing TAVR underwent echocardiography to detect PH prior to TAVR via measurement of systolic pulmonary artery pressure (sPAP). Different cut-off values were set for the presence of PH. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality at 1, 3 and 5 years. Results: Kaplan–Meier analysis by gender showed that only males exhibited significant increased mortality at elevated sPAP values during the entire follow-up period of 5 years (sPAP ≥ 40 mmHg: p ≤ 0.001 and sPAP ≥ 50 mmHg: p ≤ 0.001 in 1- to 5-year survival), whereas high sPAP values had no effect on survival in females. In Cox regression analysis based on the selected sPAP thresholds, male gender was an independent risk factor for long-term mortality after TAVR in all time courses. Conclusion: Male gender was an isolated risk factor for premature death after TAVR in patients with echocardiographic evidence of PH and severe AS. This could mean that, the indication for TAVR should be discussed more critically in men with severe AS and an elevated sPAP, while in females, PH should not be an exclusion criterion for TAVR.

AB  - Background: There are limited data on the sex differences in the hemodynamic progression and outcomes of early-stage aortic stenosis (AS). Objectives: The authors sought to determine sex differences in hemodynamic progression and outcomes of mild to moderate native AS. Methods: This was a retrospective observational cohort study including patients with mild to moderate native tricuspid AS from the Cleveland Clinic echocardiographic database between 2008 and 2016 and followed until 2018. All-cause mortality, aortic valve replacement (AVR), and disease progression assessed by annualized changes in echocardiographic parameters were analyzed based on sex. Results: The authors included 2,549 patients (mean age, 74 ± 7 years and 42.5% women) followed over a median duration of 5.7 years. There was no difference in all-cause mortality between sexes irrespective of age, baseline disease severity, progression to severe AS, and receipt of AVR. Relative to men, women had similar all-cause mortality but lower risk of AVR (adjusted HR: 0.81 [95% CI: 0.67-0.91]; P = 0.009) at 10 years. On 1:1 propensity-matched analysis, men had a significantly faster disease progression represented by greater increases in the median of annualized change in mean gradient (2.10 vs 1.15 mm Hg/y, respectively, P < 0.001), maximum transvalvular velocity (0.42 vs 0.28 m/s/y), left ventricular end-diastolic diameters (0.15 vs 0.048 mm/m2.7/y) (P = 0.014). Women have significantly higher left ventricular ejection fraction, filling pressures, and left ventricular septum thickness over time on follow-up echocardiograms compared with men. Conclusions: Women with mild to moderate AS had slower hemodynamic progression of AS, were more likely to have preserved left ventricular ejection fraction and concentric left ventricular hypertrophy in addition to lower incidence of AVR compared with men despite similar mortality. These findings provide further evidence that there are distinct sex-specific longitudinal echocardiographic and clinical profiles in patients with AS.

AB  - Aortic stenosis is the most common valvular disease of the heart and is increasing in prevalence. Previous literature has found inferior outcomes for females undergoing surgical aortic valve replacement, while recent investigations have found equivalent or superior outcomes for females undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). PubMed and Medline were systematically searched for articles published from January 1, 2010, to April 30, 2021, for retrospective and prospective studies comparing outcomes between males and females undergoing TAVR. One thousand one hundred eighty titles and abstracts were screened, and 28 were included in this review. Risk of bias was assessed using questions derived from the ROBINS-I tool and previous literature. The data were compiled and analyzed using the RevMan 5.4 software. The results of this review confirm the previously published literature and have found rates of acute kidney injury (P = 0.05) and postoperative pacemaker insertion (P < 0.00001) favoring females and in-hospital mortality (P = 0.04), stroke (P < 0.00001), bleeding complications (P < 0.00001), and vascular complications (P < 0.00001) favoring males. The previously published literature has demonstrated consistently inferior outcomes for females undergoing heart valve surgery when compared to males. However, contemporary literature investigating sex differences after TAVR has found comparable outcomes for females. While the postoperative outcomes after surgical aortic valve replacement and TAVR are well established, the causal factors are still unidentified. Future studies utilizing matching based on preoperative characteristics and follow-up including collection of postoperative ventricular remodeling and prosthetic valve performance data will aid in elucidating the causal factors impacting outcomes for males and females after TAVR.

AB  - Objectives: This study aimed to compare gender-related differences in short- and long-term outcomes after transcatheter aortic valve implantation. Methods: Patients who underwent transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) for severe aortic stenosis (AS) from September 2017 to December 2022 were enrolled. The primary endpoint was 5-year all-cause mortality. The secondary endpoints were 30-day mortality and the incidence of post-procedural complication. Patients were separated according to gender before statistical analysis. To compare patients with similar baseline characteristics, we performed a propensity matching. Results: A total of 704 patients [females, 361 (51.3%); males, 343 (48.7%)] were enrolled. Compared to women, men had a higher incidence of smoking (40.5% vs. 14.7%, p < 0.001), diabetes (32.9% vs. 25.1%, p < 0.025), peripheral artery disease (35.8% vs. 18.3%, p < 0.001), and previous cardiac surgery (13.7% vs. 7.2%, p = 0.006) and a lower ejection fraction [56.6 (9.3) vs. 59.8 (7.5), p = 0.046]. Female patients were frailer at the time of the procedure [poor mobility rate, 26% vs. 11.7%, p < 0.001; CCI (Charlson comorbidity index) 2.4 (0.67) vs. 2.32 (0.63), p = 0.04]. Despite these different risk profiles, no significant differences were reported in terms of post-procedural outcomes and long-term survival. Propensity score matching resulted in a good match of 204 patients in each group (57.9% of the entire study population). In the matched cohort, men had a significantly higher incidence of new pacemaker implantation compared to women [33 (16.2%) vs. 18 (8.8%)]. The Kaplan–Meier 5-year survival estimate was 82.4% for women and 72.1% for men, p = 0.038. Conclusions: Female gender could be considered as a predictor of better outcomes after TAVI.

AB  - Background: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is a well-established treatment for symptomatic patients with aortic stenosis. Yet, the impact of sex differences and public vs. private procedural setting on TAVI outcomes remain uncertain. Methods: The RIBAC-NT (Brazilian Registry for Evaluation of Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement Outcomes) dataset included 3194 TAVI patients from 2009 to 2021. This retrospective analysis explored disparities in baseline characteristics, procedural and in-hospital outcomes stratifying patients by sex and procedural setting. Temporal trends were also investigated. Results: We included 1551 (49 %) female and 1643 (51 %) male patients. Women were older (83 [78–87] vs. 81 [75–85] years; p < 0.01) but had a lower prevalence of diabetes mellitus (30.2 % vs. 36.3 %, p < 0.01) and coronary artery disease (39.0 % vs. 52.2 %, p < 0.01). However, women had a 3-fold higher higher risk of life-threatening bleeding (6.1 % vs. 2.4 %, p < 0.01). Women presented higher procedural and in-hospital mortality rates (4.4 % vs. 2.5 % and 7.7 % vs. 4.5 %, all p < 0.01, respectively). Although public hospitals presented ~2-fold higher procedural mortality rate compared with private settings (5.0 % vs. 2.7 %, p < 0.01), after multivariable analysis procedural setting was not independently associated with in-hospital mortality. Conclusions: Women had higher procedural and in-hospital mortality rates after TAVI as compared with men, while facing higher life-threatening bleeding and adverse events rates. Although public hospitals exhibited higher mortality rates than private centers, procedural setting was not independently associated with in-hospital mortality.

AB  - Background: Guidelines on the management of aortic aneurysm disease do not account for sex differences regarding surgical procedures on the proximal aorta, although faster aneurysm growth, increased rupture risk, and higher postoperative mortality have been found in women. We therefore analyzed outcome differences between men and women receiving operations on the proximal aorta. Methods: A total of 1773 patients underwent nonemergency surgical procedures on the aortic valve (AV) and proximal aorta at our institution between 2000 and 2018. Of these, 772 patients (21.8% women) received a Bentall procedure, 349 (20.3% women) had AV-sparing root replacement, and 652 (31.1% women) underwent AV and supracommissural ascending aorta replacement. Primary outcomes were in-hospital mortality and midterm survival. Results: When assessing sex-related differences within the entire group of patients that received an operation on the proximal aorta, women were found to be older, had a lower body mass index, and were smokers less often. Despite shorter procedural times, median ventilation times and intensive care unit length of stay were longer in women. In-house mortality was also higher in women (3.6% vs 0.9%, P < .001). Multivariable logistic regression revealed age (odds ratio [OR], 1.8; 95% CI, 1.4-2.3 per 5 years added; P < .001), female sex (OR, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.2-5.8; P = .02), and urgent surgery (OR, 3.1; 95% CI, 1.2-7.3; P = .01) as independent risk factors for in-house death. Midterm survival was lower for women in the entire cohort (P = .02) and particularly within the Bentall subgroup (P = .004). Conclusions: Female sex is an independent risk factor for operative mortality in patients undergoing proximal aortic surgery but is currently not addressed in guidelines. More research should focus on etiology and prevention of these worse outcomes in female patients.

AB  - Background: Timely management of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and acute stroke has undergone impressive progress during the last decade. However, it is currently unknown whether both sexes have profited equally from improved strategies. We sought to analyze sex-specific temporal trends in intensive care unit (ICU) admission and mortality in younger patients presenting with AMI or stroke in Switzerland. Methods: Retrospective analysis of temporal trends in 16,954 younger patients aged 18 to ≤ 52 years with AMI or acute stroke admitted to Swiss ICUs between 01/2008 and 12/2019. Results: Over a period of 12 years, ICU admissions for AMI decreased more in women than in men (− 6.4% in women versus − 4.5% in men, p < 0.001), while ICU mortality for AMI significantly increased in women (OR 1.2 [1.10–1.30], p = 0.032), but remained unchanged in men (OR 0.99 [0.94–1.03], p = 0.71). In stroke patients, ICU admission rates increased between 3.6 and 4.1% per year in both sexes, while ICU mortality tended to decrease only in women (OR 0.91 [0.85–0.95, p = 0.057], but remained essentially unaltered in men (OR 0.99 [0.94–1.03], p = 0.75). Interventions aimed at restoring tissue perfusion were more often performed in men with AMI, while no sex difference was noted in neurovascular interventions. Conclusion: Sex and gender disparities in disease management and outcomes persist in the era of modern interventional neurology and cardiology with opposite trends observed in younger stroke and AMI patients admitted to intensive care. Although our study has several limitations, our data suggest that management and selection criteria for ICU admission, particularly in younger women with AMI, should be carefully reassessed.

AB  - Background: Diabetes mellitus (DM) accelerates the progression of aortic stenosis (AS), but how their underlying molecular mechanisms interact is not clear. Moreover, whether DM contributes to clinically relevant sex-differences in AS is unknown. In this work we aim to characterize the sex-specific profile of major pathological mechanisms fundamental to aortic valve (AV) degeneration in AS patients with or without concomitant DM. Methods: 283 patients with severe AS undergoing surgical valve replacement (27.6% DM, 59.4% men) were recruited. Expression of pathological markers related to AS were thoroughly assessed in AVs and valve interstitial cells (VICs) according to sex and presence of DM. Complementary in vitro experiments in VICs in the presence of high-glucose levels (25 mM) for 24, 48 and 72 h were performed. Results: Oxidative stress and metabolic dysfunction markers were increased in AVs from diabetic AS patients compared to non-diabetic patients in both sexes. However, disbalanced oxidative stress and enhanced inflammation were more predominant in AVs from male AS diabetic patients. Osteogenic markers were exclusively increased in the AVs of diabetic women. Basal characterization of VICs confirmed that oxidative stress, inflammation, calcification, and metabolic alteration profiles were increased in diabetic VICs with sex-specific differences. VICs cultured in hyperglycemic-like conditions triggered inflammatory responses in men, whereas in women rapid and higher production of pro-osteogenic molecules. Conclusions: DM produces sex-specific pathological phenotypes in AV of AS patients. Importantly, women with diabetes are more prone to develop AV calcification. DM should be considered as a risk factor in AS especially in women.

AB  - Purpose of Review: The purpose of this paper is to review sex differences in transcatheter interventions, as detected by multimodality imaging, including echocardiography, cardiac computerized tomography, and cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging. We will review differences in anatomy, hemodynamic parameters, vascular complications, and various imaging findings that help us understand the differences in clinical outcomes in women when compared to men. Recent Findings: Several studies have been published over the past 5 years exploring the sex differences in transcatheter interventions and outcomes. The majority of these studies are retrospective analyses based on registry data given the novelty of many of these techniques. The sex differences vary based on the valve in question and specific technique employed. In this review, we attempt to highlight and summarize some of these findings. Summary: Understanding sex differences in transcatheter interventions is critical to ensure the most favorable outcomes for all patients undergoing these procedures. Additional studies are necessary to further explore these differences as these novel techniques become more readily available.

AB  - In cardiac surgery, women have higher short-term mortality and a higher risk of receiving red blood cell (RBC) transfusions than men. This study’s aim was to evaluate possible sex differences in RBC transfusions in cardiac surgery and their association with preoperative hemoglobin levels, body mass index, and 30-day mortality. A single-center retrospective study was conducted with 1583 patients (1181 men and 402 women) undergoing cardiac surgery. A total of 64.4% of the women and 33.0% of the men received an RBC transfusion. In a multivariable analysis, female sex was an independent predictor of RBC transfusion (OR 3.88, 95% CI 2.95–5.11, p < 0.001). Other independent predictors of RBC transfusion were age, preoperative hemoglobin level, and body mass index. The women were more likely to receive RBC transfusions than the men, regardless of the type of cardiac surgery. Decreased transfusion risk was found in all higher-than-normal weight categories in the women, but only in the severe obesity category in the men. Preoperative hemoglobin was similarly associated with RBC transfusion in the men and women. The crude 30-day mortality rate was higher in the women than in the men (2.5% vs. 0.9%, p = 0.018). In both sexes, RBC transfusion was associated with an increased probability of death within 30 days.

AB  - Background: Current guidelines recommend selecting surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) or transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) based on age, comorbidities, and surgical risk. Nevertheless, reports from the United States suggest a rapid expansion of TAVR in young patients. Objectives: The authors sought to evaluate the trends in TAVR uptake at a nationwide level in France according to age and sex. Methods: Using a nationwide administrative database, we evaluated age- and sex-related trends in TAVR uptake, patient demographics, and in-hospital outcomes between 2015 and 2020. Results: A total of 107,397 patients (44.0% female) underwent an isolated aortic valve replacement (AVR) (59.1% TAVR, 40.9% SAVR). In patients <65 years of age, the proportion of TAVR increased by 63.2% (P < 0.001) from 2015 to 2020 but remained uncommon at 11.1% of all AVR by 2020 (12.4% in females, 10.6% in males) while TAVR was the dominant modality in patients ≥65 years of age. In patients undergoing TAVR, the Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) (P = 0.119 for trend) and in-hospital mortality (P = 0.740 for trend) remained unchanged in patients <65 years of age but declined in those ≥65 years of age irrespective of sex (all P < 0.001 for trends). Females were older (P < 0.001), had lower CCI (P < 0.001), were more likely to undergo TAVR (P < 0.001), and experienced higher in-hospital mortality (TAVR, P = 0.015; SAVR, P < 0.001) that persisted despite adjustment for age and CCI. Conclusions: In France, the use of TAVR remained uncommon in young patients, predominantly restricted to those at high risk. Important sex differences were observed in patent demographics, selection of AVR modality, and patient outcomes. Additional research evaluating the long-term impact of TAVR use in young patients and prospective data evaluating sex differences in AVR modality selection and outcomes are needed.

AB  - There are known pathophysiologic and clinical differences according to sex in patients with aortic stenosis (AS). To evaluate if these differences persist after valve replacement, we conducted an observational study including 451 patients with symptomatic AS who survived aortic valve intervention (AVI) in two centers. Clinical data and mortality were evaluated at a mean follow-up of 5 years. 56% of patients were women. At baseline, women were older (80.6 vs. 78 years, p = 0.013), presented higher mean gradient (48 vs. 45 mmHg, p = 0.023), lower aortic valve area (0.70 vs. 0.74 cm2, p = 0.002) and higher systolic pulmonary artery pressure (36 vs. 33 mmHg, p = 0.016). They underwent percutaneous aortic valve replacement more frequently than men (47 vs. 35.9%, p = 0.017). At 5 years follow-up, women required more admissions due to heart failure (23 vs. 9%, p = 0.046) but they did not present higher cardiovascular nor overall mortality (27.7% vs. 29.8%, p = 0.741; 11.1 vs. 10.1%, p = 0.619, respectively). Female sex was an independent predictor of heart failure hospitalization at follow-up (HR 95% 1.16–4.22, p = 0.016). Women undergo AVI at a more advanced stage than men, resulting in a higher frequency of readmissions due to heart failure during the follow-up period, but not in higher mortality.

AB  - Background: Sex-specific differences in heart disease outcomes are influenced by the levels of the steroid hormones, estrogen and testosterone. While the roles of estrogen receptors in cardiac disease are well-studied in animals and humans, respective research on androgen receptors (AR) is limited. Here we investigate AR protein and mRNA expression in human myocardium of various cardiac diseases. Methods: AR expression was analyzed by western blotting in myocardium from human non-failing hearts (NF, n = 6) and patients with aortic stenosis (AS, n = 6), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM, n = 7), dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM, n = 7), and ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM, n = 7). Using an AR45-specific antibody, a subsequent western blot assessed samples from male and female patients with HCM (n = 10) and DCM (n = 10). The same sample set was probed for full-length AR and AR45 mRNA expression. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) localized AR in myocardium from HCM and AS hearts. Results: Full-length AR was notably enriched in AS and HCM hearts compared to ICM, DCM, and NF. Similarly, AR45 was more abundant in HCM than in DCM. In contrast to the pattern observed for AR protein, full-length AR mRNA levels were lower in HCM compared to DCM, with no discernible difference for the AR45 isoform. Although gender differences in AR expression were not detected in western blots or qRT-PCR, IHC showed stronger nuclear AR signals in males than in females. Conclusions: Our findings indicate disease-specific regulation of AR mRNA and/or AR protein in cardiac hypertrophy, underscoring a potential role in this cardiac pathology.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Contemporary literature has demonstrated inferior outcomes for females in various cardiovascular disease states and interventions. Differences in baseline characteristics, patient presentation, and intraoperative parameters have been proposed to underlie this discrepancy. Previous studies investigating sex differences in outcomes of surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) have indicated conflicting results and hence there remains a lack of clarity on whether female sex is an independent risk factor for inferior outcomes. In this retrospective, propensity-matched, single-center study we compare the 15-year outcomes of isolated surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR). METHODS AND RESULTS: 4927 patients underwent SAVR at the Mazankowski Alberta Heart Institute between 2004-2018. Propensity-matching identified 531 males and females who underwent isolated SAVR. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality during the follow-up period. Secondary outcomes consisted of intraoperative parameters and several measures of postoperative morbidity, including readmission for myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, or redo aortic valve replacement (AVR). There was no significant difference in the baseline characteristics between the propensity-matched groups. Cardiopulmonary bypass (109±37 vs 103±29 minutes; p=0.011) and aortic cross-clamp times (83±27 vs 79±25 minutes; p=0.037) were significantly longer in males as compared to females. There was no difference in the proportion of mechanical and tissue valves implanted between the sexes. No significant difference in mortality at 30-days (0.8% vs 1.5%; p=0.247), 1 year (4.0% vs 4.0%; p=0.988), 5 years (9.6% vs 10.6%; p=0.550), or 15 years (16.2% vs 16.4%, p=0.714) was identified. Redo aortic valve replacement trended towards favouring males at the longest available follow-up (2.8% vs 1.3%; p=0.067); however, all other measures of postoperative morbidity were comparable between groups with no significant differences noted. CONCLUSION: This study examined the long-term outcomes of propensity-matched males and females undergoing isolated surgical aortic valve replacement and identified no significant differences in outcomes over a 15-year follow-up period. Despite previous literature reporting inferior outcomes for females following aortic valve surgery, by accounting for baseline patient characteristics and concomitant procedures equivalent rates of postoperative morbidity and mortality are apparent. Consequently, sex does not appear to be an independent risk factor following isolated surgical aortic valve replacement. [Formula presented] [Formula presented]

AB  - Aims Increasing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) rates have resulted in prolonged waiting times. These have been associated with heart failure hospitalizations (HFH) and mortality yet sex differences have not yet been reported. Methods and All patients who underwent TAVI for severe aortic stenosis at a tertiary referral hospital in Australia were prospectively results included. Total waiting time was divided into ‘work-up’ waiting time (period from referral date until heart team approval) and, ‘procedural’ waiting time (period from heart team approval until procedure date). Patients were analysed according to sex. Cohorts were matched to correct for differences in baseline and procedural variables. The primary endpoints were waiting times. Secondary outcomes included a composite of 30-day mortality and HFH, quality of life, and mobility. A total of 407 patients (42% women) were included. After matching of the two cohorts (345 patients), women had significantly longer total waiting times than men: median 156 [interquartile range (IQR) 114–220] days in women vs. 147 [IQR 92–204] days in men (P = 0.037) including longer work-up (83 [IQR 50–128] vs. 71 [IQR 36–119], P = 0.15) and procedural waiting times (65 [IQR 44–100] vs. 58 [IQR 30–93], P = 0.042). Increasing waiting times were associated with higher 30-day mortality and HFH (P = 0.01 for work-up waiting time, P = 0.02 for procedural waiting time) and decreased 30-day mobility (P = 0.044 for procedural waiting time) in women, but not in men. Conclusion TAVI waiting times are significantly longer in women compared to men and are associated with increased mortality and HFH and reduced mobility at 30-days.

AB  - Introduction: Redo surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) remains the gold standard for the management of failed bioprosthetic valves (BV). We aim to determine if there are sex differences in in-hospital outcomes among patients who underwent redo-SAVR for failed BV. Methods: We obtained the data from the National Inpatient Sample from 2013-2020. Our primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included acute stroke, acute myocardial infarction (MI), acute kidney injury post-operative bleeding and blood transfusion. (See figure 1). Multivariable regression analyses were done to adjust for confounders. Results: There were more men who underwent the procedure compared to women. (62.3% versus 37.7%, p<0.001) Hypertension, coronary artery disease and smoking were commonly seen among men. Obesity is more common among women. There was no difference in in-hospital mortality. Men were less likely than women to have vascular complications (adjusted odd ratio (aOR) 0.63, p<0.005; acute kidney injury aOR 0.63, p< 0.01, and acute stroke (aOR 0.6, p< 0.002). Conclusions: Men underwent more redo-SAVR procedures than women. There were no sex difference in inhospital outcomes, however, men were less likely to have AKI, stroke and vascular complications from the procedure. Further research is needed to explore these sex disparities. .

AB  - Background: There is still controversy about survival rates and clinical response of women versus men who undergo transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) for the treatment of severe aortic stenosis (SAS). Purpose: Assess mortality and heart failure (HF) symptoms following TAVI for SAS, according to sex. Methods: A retrospective analysis of a single-center database including all TAVI performed in 2011-2019 was performed. Clinical, echocardiographic, and blood-analysis data were determined, and all-cause mortality over the five years after the procedure was compared based on sex. A reduction of at least one New York Heart Association (NYHA) class after TAVI was the secondary endpoint. Results: Of the 488 cases analyzed, 252 (51.6%) were women. They were older (84 vs. 80 years-old, p<0.001), had a lower body surface area, and had a higher estimated surgical risk, as determined by EuroSCORE II (4.5 vs. 3.8, p=0.011) and STS-mortality (4.46 vs. 3.44, p<0.001). However, they had a lower prevalence of diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, and peripheral artery disease, a lower estimated creatinine clearance, and a lower frequency of previous pacemaker implantation. Women had more frequently a phenotype of high gradient severe aortic stenosis, with lower functional aortic valve areas. While there was no difference in TAVI design, smaller valves were implanted in women. Median follow-up was 46 months and there was a 40% mortality rate over the five years after treatment, with no statistically significant differences according to sex in both univariate and multivariate analysis, after adjusting for estimated surgical risk. EuroSCORE II had a statistically significant association with the primary endpoint (hazard ratio 1.03 (1.01-1.05), p=0.004). Despite having a similar NYHA class before TAVI, women experienced a lower frequency of functional class improvement (61% vs. 72%, p=0.034). Conclusions: Although women had a higher estimated surgical risk, no differences were found regarding survival after TAVI for SAS. However, improvement in HF symptoms was less frequent in this subset.

AB  - Background: Aortic stenosis (AS) produces an increased afterload and consequently left ventricular (LV) remodeling. While current guidelines recommend the same echo-doppler criteria for diagnosis and grading of AS for men and women, different sex-specific patterns of cardiac remodeling, and eventually damage, have been reported. Whether these different patterns are caused by sex-related AS progression rate or myocardial response is less well known. Aim: We aim to compare longitudinal changes in aortic valve and cardiac function between women and men with AS to investigate sex-related differences in AS progression and cardiac remodeling. Methods: Patients with mild-to-severe AS and LV ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥ 50 % at least in 2 transthoracic echocardiograms (TTE) were retrospectively identified. Prosthetic and bicuspid valves were excluded. Serial TTEs provided a multiparametric framework to compare AS severity, progression rate and induced cardiac changes between sexes. Results: 914 patients were included (median follow-up time of 6.8 years) and 52 % (473) were female. Both sexes had similar baseline aortic peak velocities (APV) (2.9±0.9 m/s), mean pressure gradient (MPG) (27±13 mmHg) and LVEF (60±5 %). Women were older (75±9 vs 73±8 years; p<0.001), had smaller body surface area (BSA) (1.70±0.15 vs 1.88±0.16 m2, p<0.001), proportionally lower stroke volume (SV) (82±19 mL vs 91±22 mL, p<0.001), lower indexed LV mass (iLVM) (118±33 g/m2 vs 125±28 g/m2, p<0.001) and higher indexed left atrial (LA) volume (39±13 vs 49±20 mL/m2, p<0.001). The average annual progression rate of APV and MPG was similar for both groups (2 mmHg/year and 0.14 m s-1 year-1). After multivariate adjustment including time-dependent aortic valve replacement, women had a higher incidence of severe LV hypertrophy as measured by iLVM (HR=1.16, CI=1.08-1.91, p<0.01), moderate-to-severe tricuspid valve regurgitation (HR=2.03, CI=1.01-4.07, p<0.05) and pulmonary hypertension (PHT) (HR=1.49, CI=1.02-2.18, p=0.04) at 5 years. Similar incidence rates were seen for LV dilation, LVEF reduction and mitral valve regurgitation. All-cause mortality rates were similar between groups (p=0.30). Conclusion: This study suggests that under similar static and dynamic loading conditions, women will develop severe LV hypertrophy and PHT earlier than men, possibly reflecting sex-specific response differences intrinsic to the myocardium. This suggests that the definition of AS severity may benefit from a shift from a valve-focused to a myocardial-integrative approach taking gender into account.

AB  - Background: The transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) in patients with aortic stenosis (AS) asserts mechanical forces during valve expansion both on the aortic root and conduction system. TAVI is therefore frequently associated with the development of conduction abnormalities requiring a permanent pacemaker implantation (PMI). Purpose: To identify predictors of new PMI in unselected patients with severe AS undergoing TAVI. Methods: Among the 600 patients consecutively enrolled in TAVI-NOR study, 52 had PMI prior to TAVI and were excluded, remaining 548 patients eligible for this analysis. Predictors of PMI were identified in binary logistic regression analyses. Results: A total of 189 patients (31.5%) required a new PMI post TAVI, evenly distributed between females and males (30.1% vs 32.9%, p=0.456). Higher age, comorbidities such as hypertension, chronic kidney disease, coronary artery disease, diabetes, and left ventricular hypertrophy on ECG or echocardiography, and the severity of AS had no association with the risk of PMI after TAVI (Table 1). In univariate logistic regression analyses, larger aortic root diameter was associated with a higher risk of new PMI (OR 1.66; 95% 1.07-2.58, p=0.024), but was no longer significant in multivariate model, and bioprosthesis size had no association with the need for a PMI following TAVI. Bundle branch block (BBB) (OR 1.52; 95% 1.00-2.31, p= 0.051), and especially right BBB (RBBB) (OR 2.05; 95% 1.14-3.70, p= 0.017) showed increased risk of a new PMI, also in a multivariable-adjusted analysis (OR 2.67; 95% 1.39-5.11, p=0.003). Lotus bioprosthesis with mechanical expansion was associated with an increased risk of PMI (OR 2.92; 95% CI 1.92-4.45, p<0.001), while balloon expandable Sapiens had a lower risk for PMI (OR 0.15; 95% CI 0.06-0.37, p<0.001). In a multivariable-adjusted analysis, the use of Lotus valve (OR 2.23; 95% CI 1.44-3.46, p<0.001) was still associated with a higher risk, and use of Sapien with a lower risk of PMI (OR 0.15; 95% CI 0.06-0.40, p<0.001) independent of non-significant association with atrial fibrillation (p=0.067), lower heart rate (0.077), aortic root (p=0.225) and stroke volume index (p=0.097). Adding age and gender to the same primary multivariable-adjusted model did not change our conclusions: Lotus (OR 2.28; 95% CI 1.46-3.57, p<0.001) and RBBB (OR 2.63; 95% CI 1.37-5.04, p=0.004) and Edward Sapien (OR 0.15; 95% 0.06-0.39, p<0.001) of post-procedural PMI. Conclusion: Our data from less selected patients with severe AS patients show that pre-intervention RBBB and the use of bioprosthesis with mechanic expansion (Lotus) were associated with a higher risk, and the use of balloon expandable bioprothesis (Sapiens) with a lower risk of PMI after TAVI. We found no gender differences in risk of PMI.

AB  - Background: Significant aortic regurgitation (AR) leads to left ventricular (LV) remodelling and poor outcomes if untreated; however, data on sex-differences in the setting of significant AR is scare. Purpose: To examine contemporary clinical and echocardiographic differences between men and women with significant chronic AR. Methods and results: Consecutive patients with significant AR evaluated in a heart valve clinic following a comprehensive clinical and imaging protocol were included. Comparison was performed between genders. A total of 206 patients with significant AR were included (130 grade III, 76 grade IV AR) (mean age 69 years, 49% women). Mean follow-up was 3.7 years. Women showed similar comorbidities, but were older (66.5 vs 71.4, p=0.017), and more symptomatic. Women were smaller in terms of height, weight and surface area, showing significantly smaller volumes and diameters (LVEDD 52 ± 6.2 mm men vs 47.0 ±6.7 mm women, p<0.001). However, when diameters were normalized, no significant differences were seen between men and women. Hospital admissions due to heart failure and number of surgeries were not significantly different between genders. Conclusion: In patients with significant AR, indication for intervention in guidelines is based on the same values for both men and women. However, women were more symptomatic and showed significantly smaller volumes and diameters. Indexed values should be considered in decision making taking into account differences in gender.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Contemporary literature has demonstrated inferior outcomes for females in various cardiovascular disease states and interventions. Differences in baseline characteristics, patient presentation, and intraoperative parameters have been proposed to underlie this discrepancy. Previous studies investigating sex differences in outcomes of surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) have indicated conflicting results and hence there remains a lack of clarity on whether female sex is an independent risk factor for inferior outcomes. In this retrospective, propensity-matched, single-center study we compare the 15-year outcomes of isolated surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR). METHODS AND RESULTS: 4927 patients underwent SAVR at the Mazankowski Alberta Heart Institute between 2004-2018. Propensity-matching identified 531 males and females who underwent isolated SAVR. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality during the follow-up period. Secondary outcomes consisted of intraoperative parameters and several measures of postoperative morbidity, including readmission for myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, or redo aortic valve replacement (AVR). There was no significant difference in the baseline characteristics between the propensity-matched groups. Cardiopulmonary bypass (109±37 vs 103±29 minutes; p=0.011) and aortic cross-clamp times (83±27 vs 79±25 minutes; p=0.037) were significantly longer in males as compared to females. There was no difference in the proportion of mechanical and tissue valves implanted between the sexes. No significant difference in mortality at 30-days (0.8% vs 1.5%; p=0.247), 1 year (4.0% vs 4.0%; p=0.988), 5 years (9.6% vs 10.6%; p=0.550), or 15 years (16.2% vs 16.4%, p=0.714) was identified. Redo aortic valve replacement trended towards favouring males at the longest available follow-up (2.8% vs 1.3%; p=0.067); however, all other measures of postoperative morbidity were comparable between groups with no significant differences noted. CONCLUSION: This study examined the long-term outcomes of propensity-matched males and females undergoing isolated surgical aortic valve replacement and identified no significant differences in outcomes over a 15-year follow-up period. Despite previous literature reporting inferior outcomes for females following aortic valve surgery, by accounting for baseline patient characteristics and concomitant procedures equivalent rates of postoperative morbidity and mortality are apparent. Consequently, sex does not appear to be an independent risk factor following isolated surgical aortic valve replacement. [Formula presented] [Formula presented]

AB  - Background: Evidence regarding sex-related differences in response to transcatheter aortic valve implantation according to the valve type is lacking. This study sought to evaluate the impact of sex on the treatment effect of Evolut-PRO/PRO+ (PRO) or Sapien 3 Ultra (ULTRA) devices on clinical outcomes. Methods: Comparative Analysis of Evolut PRO vs Sapien 3 Ultra Valves for Transfemoral Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (OPERA-TAVI) is a multicenter multinational registry including patients undergoing latest-iteration PRO or ULTRA implantation. Overall, 1174 out of 1897 patients were matched based on valve type and compared according to sex, while 470 males and 630 females were matched and compared according to valve type. Thirty-day and 1-year outcomes were evaluated. Results: In both PRO and ULTRA group, males had a higher comorbidity burden, while females had smaller aortic root. Both 30-day (device success [DS], early safety outcome, permanent pacemaker implantation [PPI], patient-prosthesis mismatch [PPM], paravalvular regurgitation [PVR], bleedings, vascular complications, and all-cause death) and 1-year outcomes (all-cause death, stroke and heart failure hospitalization) did not differ according to sex in both valve groups. However, male sex decreased the likelihood of 30-day DS with ULTRA versus PRO (p for interaction 0.047). A higher risk of 30-day PPI and 1-year stroke, and a lower risk of PPM was observed in PRO versus ULTRA, regardless of sex. No other differences were noted. Conclusions: Sex did not modify the treatment effect of PRO versus ULTRA on clinical outcomes, with the exception of 30-day DS that was decreased in males (versus females) receiving ULTRA (versus PRO).

AB  - Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is currently the treatment of choice for patients aged ≥75 years with severe aortic stenosis. Preoperative anemia is present in a large proportion of patients and may increase the risk of post-procedural complications. The purpose of this prognostic systematic review was to analyze the impact of baseline anemia on short- and mid-term outcomes following TAVR. A computerized search was performed on PubMed and Web of Science databases for studies published between January 2013 and December 2022. Primary outcomes were 30-day need for transfusion, acute renal failure, 30-day and mid-term mortality, and readmission during the first year post-TAVR. Data were analyzed via random effects model using inverse variance method with 95% confidence intervals. Eleven observational studies met our eligibility criteria and included a total of 12,588 patients. The prevalence of baseline anemia ranged between 39% and 72%, with no relevant sex differences. Patients with preprocedural anemia received more blood transfusions [OR: 2.95 (2.13–4.09)]), and exhibited increased rates of acute kidney injury [OR:1.74 (1.45–2.10)], short-term mortality [OR: 1.47 (1.07–2.01], and mid-term [OR: 1.89 (1.58–2.25)] mortality following TAVR compared with those without anemia. Baseline anemia determined an increased risk for blood transfusion, acute kidney injury, and short/mid-term mortality among TAVR recipients.

AB  - PURPOSE: This study explored the sex differences in the outcomes of degenerative mitral valve repair (MVr). METHODS: From 2010 to 2019, 1069 patients who underwent MVr due to degenerative mitral disease at Beijing Anzhen Hospital were analyzed. The average patient follow-up was 5.1 years (interquartile range: 5-7 years). The primary endpoint was overall survival. Secondary endpoints were freedom from reoperation and recurrent mitral regurgitation. A propensity-matched analysis was used to compare the outcomes of males and females. RESULTS: Females were older, had a higher prevalence of atrial fibrillation and moderate-to-severe tricuspid regurgitation, and had smaller left atrial, left ventricular end-diastolic, and left ventricular end-systolic diameters. Males were more likely to undergo concomitant coronary artery bypass grafting and had longer cardiopulmonary bypass and aortic cross-clamp times. The in-hospital mortality was <1% (10/1,069). After propensity score matching of 331 pairs of patients, most variables were well balanced. Before and after propensity score matching, the long-term survival and freedom from reoperation rates were similar. Males had higher durability after surgery compared with females. CONCLUSIONS: Females were referred to surgery later and had more complications than males. Long-term survival and freedom from reoperation rates were not significantly different between the sexes.

AB  - Background: In acute aortic dissection (AAD) sex heterogeneity reports are not exhaustive and in part even conflicting. Aims: To explore sex differences in clinical features, management, and outcomes among patients with type A AAD. Methods and results: A systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature were conducted for studies (2004-2022) reporting type A AAD sex differences. Among the 1938 studies retrieved, 16 (16 069 patients, 7142 women, and 8927 men) fulfilled all eligibility criteria. Data were aggregated used the random-effects model as pooled risk ratio and mean difference. Due to information reported by considered manuscripts, analysis were performed only among surgically treated type A AAD patients. At the time of hospital presentation type A AAD women were older than men but had lower body mass index (BMI), body surface area (BSA), and creatinine plasma levels. Active smoking, bicuspid aortic valve, and previous cardiac surgery were less common in women while diabetes mellitus was more frequent. Furthermore, women experienced more frequently pericardial effusion/cardiac tamponade than men. Interestingly, in-hospital surgical mortality did not differ between sexes [risk ratio (RR), 1.02 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.53-1.99 P = 0.95], whereas 5 (RR 0.94 95% CI: 0.92-0.97 P < 0.001) and 10-year survival (RR 0.82 95% CI: 0.74-0.92 P = 0.004) was higher among men. A descriptive analysis of in-hospital outcomes among medically treated type A AAD patients confirmed prohibitive high mortality for both sexes (men 58.6% vs. women 53.8%, P = 0.59). Conclusions: A female sex phenotype appears to be evident in type A AAD implying the need for a personalized management patient approach along with tailored preventive strategies.

AB  - Subclinical leaflet thrombosis is characterized by hypoattenuated leaflet thickening (HALT) after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) on computed tomography. However, given the low incidence of HALT after TAVR, the clinical significance of HALT is still being investigated. We sought to generate a more reliable estimate of the risk factors and adverse outcomes associated with HALT after TAVR by pooling data from randomized trials and cohort studies. PubMed/Medline database was systematically searched from inception until November 24, 2021, using the following terms: (“hypoattenuated leaflet thickening” and “transcatheter aortic valve replacement”) and (“Subclinical leaflet thrombosis” and “transcatheter aortic valve replacement”). A random effects model meta-analysis was conducted using Mantel-Haenszel odds ratios (ORs) and the associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs), mean difference and the associated 95%. Ten studies with a total of 1462 patients were included, with follow-up ranging between 4 months and 3 years. HALT occurred in 14.4% of the patients undergoing TAVR. HALT was not associated with increased risk of stroke/TIA (OR 1.38; 95% CI [0.61-3.11]; I2=0%) or increased risk of all-cause mortality (OR 0.67; 95% CI [0.25-1.80]; I2=0). HALT was associated with a greater post-procedural mean aortic valve gradient (mean difference 2.31 mmHg; 95% CI [0.27, 4.35]; I2=71%). Interestingly, there was a trend of higher risk of HALT in men (OR 1.37; 95% CI [0.82-2.30]; I2=44%) while there was a trend towards lower risk of HALT in the presence of CKD (OR 0.76; 95% CI [0.49-1.19]; I2=0%); these trends did not reach statistical significance. This meta-analysis shows that the occurrence of HALT following TAVR is associated with a greater post-procedural mean aortic valve gradient but no excess risk of death or cerebrovascular events. The clinical significance of this higher post-procedural mean aortic valve gradient is uncertain and requires further investigations.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Physical activity (PA) is an important clinical and quality of life outcome after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). We examined the effect of TAVR on objectively measured PA in patients with cardiac implanted electronic devices (CIEDs). METHODS: Daily accelerometer data was obtained from CIEDs. Patients in the University of North Carolina Health System with continuous PA data at least 6 months before TAVR and 12 months after TAVR were included. Changes in activity pre-and post-TAVR were analyzed with linear mixed-effects models using a random intercept for each patient. An interaction term was included to determine differences in PA between men and women pre-and post-TAVR. RESULTS: Of the 306 patients with CIEDs who underwent TAVR, 24,655 patient-days of data from 46 patients, mean age of 82 years old, 44% of whom were female met inclusion criteria. A significant and sustained increase of 14.7% in daily PA was seen after TAVR [10.15 minutes per day, 95% confidence interval (CI) 8.75 to 11.56 P<.001] after adjusting for sex, obesity, race, history of depression, and Charlson Comorbidity Index. Effects were more prominent in women (18.57 [95% CI 16.36 to 20.79, P<.001] minute increase post-TAVR) compared to men (4.51 [95% CI 3.87 to 5.16] minute increase post-TAVR, P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates PA increases after TAVR with effects more pronounced in women than men. Further, this study highlights the potential use of remote monitoring data for monitoring functional outcomes in device patients after a procedure.

AB  - Introduction: Combined coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and aortic valve replacement (AVR), and female gender are associated with increased perioperative mortality in clinical risk scores. This study investigated gender differences in short-term outcome stratified by age groups. Method: All patients undergoing AVR and CABG between January 2001 and June 2021 at our institution were included. 1963 patients were grouped by decades into: 59 years and younger (n = 127), 60-69 (n = 471), 70-79 (n = 1070) and 80 years and older (n = 295). The primary end points of this study were 30-and 180-days mortality. Secondary end points were influence of preoperative risk factors and impact of gender on survival and postoperative major adverse events. Results: Female patients showed higher 30-and 180-days mortality after combined CABG and AVR surgery (8.3% vs. 4.2%, p <.001; 15.8% vs. 9.4%, p <.001). Stratified by age groups 30-and 180-days mortality, remained significantly higher in septuagenarians (9.6% vs. 2.5%, p <.001; 16.3% vs. 7.7%, p <.001). Females were significantly older, had better preserved left ventricular function and higher incidence of diabetes mellitus compared to male patients in this subgroup (p <.001; p = .01; p <.001). Additionally, females received significantly less internal mammary artery (IMA) conduits (p <.001). Female gender (OR: 3.33, 95%-CI: [1.76-6.31]; 1.93, [1.22-3.06]), higher age (1.28, [1.13-1.45]; 1.16, [1.06-1.26]), diabetes mellitus (1.93, [1.03-3.60]; 1.70, [1.08-2.67]) and LVEF <30% (3.26, [1.48-7.17]; 2.23, [1.24-4.02]) were correlated with 30-and 180-days mortality, respectively. Upon multivariable testing, gender (1.77, [1.21-2.58]) and LVEF <30% (3.71, [2.39-5.76]) remained significant risk factors for major adverse postoperative events. Infrequent use of IMA grafts was associated with increased 30-and 180-days mortality as well as adverse events (0.47, [0.25-0.87]; 0.46, [0.29-0.72]; 0.61, [0.42-0.88]). Conclusion: Gender disparities in baseline characteristics may delay operative intervention in female patients. The inherent risk profiles might be responsible for outcome differences in septuagenarians.

AB  - Background: Aortic stenosis (AS) is the most common valvular heart disease in developed countries and when indicated can be treated with transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). Recently, a cardiac damage staging (including the left ventricle, the left atrium and mitral regurgitation, the pulmonary pressures and tricuspid regurgitation, and finally the right ventricle, Figure 1) has been proposed in severe AS to optimize risk stratification, but there is still paucity of data about potential sex-differences for this classification Purpose: to identify differences between men and women in cardiac damage before and after TAVI, and evaluate the potential prognostic value Methods: A total of 734 patients with severe AS undergoing TAVI were included. Demographic and clinical data were collected before TAVI Echocardiography was performed before and 6 months after TAVI, and patients were hierarchically classified in a given cardiac damage stage (worst stage) if at least one of the proposed criteria was met (Figure 1). The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality at long-term follow-up (3.2 years ± 1.3 starting from the 6 months follow-up echocardiography) Results: At baseline women (n=334, 45%) were older (81.3 ± 6.7 years vs 78.5 ± 7.7 years, p<0.0001), had fewer cardiovascular risk factors but higher heart rate and blood pressure compared to men. By echocardiography before TAVI, cardiac damage distribution was overall comparable (p = 0.056) between men and women although women showed higher percentage of patients in stage 3 (p<0.05, Figure 2). After TAVI, an improvement in cardiac damage staging was observed with less patients in stage 3 and 4, but a significant difference (p<0.0001) was observed between men and women, having women still more patients in stage 3 (p<0.05) and men more patients in stage 4 (p<0.05) (Figure 2) During long-term follow-up, 206 events occurred (n=79 in women and n=127 in men) and Kaplan-Meier curve analysis illustrated that women had better survival than men (Log-rank p = 0.018; Chi-square 5.642) after TAVI. However, in the multivariate cox regression analysis, at each increment of cardiac damage stage women had higher increased risk for all-cause mortality (HR 1.480, CI 1.143-1.914, p = 0.003) as compared to men (HR 1.206, CI 1.002-1.451, p = 0.003) after adjusting for significant clinical covariates Conclusions: Women and men with severe AS present different cardiac damage staging namely after treatment with TAVI. Although women show better survival after TAVI, cardiac damage staging is of important prognostic value in both sex.

AB  - Background: Stroke and bleeding are complications after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). A higher incidence of bleeding and stroke has been reported in women, but the role of antithrombotic management pre- and post-TAVR has not been studied. Objectives: The study sought to compare bleeding and ischemic complications after TAVR between women and men stratified by antiplatelet and oral anticoagulant (OAC) regimen. Methods: The POPular TAVI (Antiplatelet Therapy for Patients Undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation) trial was a randomized clinical trial to test the hypothesis that monotherapy with aspirin or OAC after TAVR is safer than the addition of clopidogrel. The primary endpoints of interest of this post hoc subanalysis were: 1) all bleeding; and 2) a composite of ischemic events consisting of stroke and myocardial infarction. Secondary endpoints were: 1) nonprocedural bleeding; 2) major or life-threatening bleeding; 3) minor bleeding; 4) stroke; 5) myocardial infarction; and 6) all-cause death. Results: A total of 978 patients (466 [47.6%] women) were included in this study. All bleeding and the composite of myocardial infarction and stroke rates were similar between sexes (all bleeding: 106 [22.8%] women vs 121 [23.6%] men; P = 0.815; ischemic events: 26 [5.6%] vs 36 [7.0%]; P = 0.429). However, major or life-threatening bleeding occurred more often in women (58 [12.5%]) vs men (38 [7.4%]) (P = 0.011), most of which were access site bleedings. The use of aspirin pre- and post-TAVR increased major or life-threatening bleeding in women but not in men. Conclusions: After TAVR, overall bleeding and ischemic outcomes were similar between women and men. However, women had more major or life-threatening bleedings, especially those receiving aspirin pre- and post-TAVR.

AB  - Cardiovascular disease is leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Although women generally have a lower prevalence of CVD than men. Number of studies has shown that after an acute cardiovascular (CV) event, women have a greater death rate and a worse prognosis. Gender differences between men and women in terms of epidemiology, pathophysiology and remedial issues are of due to differences in gene expression from the sex chromosomes and posterior differences in sex hormones. According to western societies, majority of ischemic heart disease occurs 7-10 times later in women than in men. Men are more likely, around 3-4 times than women to suffer from ST – elevated myocardial infaction (STEMI) or non-STEMI. In this review, we summarized the gender differences of several typical cardiovascular diseases including coronary artery disease, heart failure, LBBB, atrial fibrillation, effect of drugs and risk factors. Cardiovascular death in women is major concern which is still under-recognition and untreated. Consideration of gender differences is important for prevention, diagnosis, treatment and management of CVD.

AB  - Background and Aim: Marfan and Loeys-Dietz syndromes are associated connective tissue disorders progressing from childhood. Figure 1 Kaplan-Meier analysis for all cause mortality for whole cohort (A) and for RASopathy syndrome (B) for Follow up (months) Major morbidity and mortality in both syndromes relate to aorta dilation predisposing to aortic tear. We investigated a putative relationship between genotype and aortic disease progression in young patients that can potentially lead to severe cardiovascular events. Method: 100 patients (51 male, 49 female) with pathogenic variants in FBN1 (N = 84), TGFβR1/R2 (N= 8) and SMAD3 (N = 8) genes were subject to retrospective analysis. The average age at study onset was 13.8 years and data were collected over 5 years. The FBN1 variants were classified as premature termination codon (PTC, N= 33) or dominant negative (DN, N= 51). Among DN variants 14 cases of cysteine loss (Cys-), severely affecting protein conformation, were analysed separately. Aortic diameters and aortic dilation at the level of the Valsalva sinuses were assessed by echocardiography. Results: A link was found between gender and aortic diameter evolution (median females 3.8mm vs males 6.3mm; p = 0.0089) and growth rate (1.0mm/year females vs 1.4 mm/year males; p = 0.0061). No overall differences were found between Marfan and Loeys-Dietz syndrome neither between PTC, DN and Loeys-Dietz patients. However, the aortic diameter evolution over 5 years was significantly higher in Cys-patients, with median 8.70mm against 4.00mm for other genotypes (p = 0.0007);ORadjusted for gender was 1.3[1.1-1.5], p = 0.003. The median growth rate was 1.53mm/year in Cys-patients against 1.04mm/year for other patients (p = 0.0127), adjusted on gender. No significant difference was found between gender distribution in Cys-and the remaining patients (p = 0.15). Interestingly, mitral valve surgery was only reported in PTC patients (3/33, p = 0.03). Conclusions: Our study shows that gender differences in aortic disease progression are significant since childhood. Male patients should be monitored more closely, with emphasis on FBN1 variants with loss of cysteine.

TI  - Sex Differences in Cardiac Damage in Aortic Stenosis
AU  - Mohanty, S.
AU  - Wessler, B.S.
T2  - Journal of Clinical and Translational Science
AB  - OBJECTIVES/GOALS: Sex differences in aortic stenosis (AS) are vastly underestimated, contribute to disparities in treatment and worse outcomes for women including disproportionately higher mortality rates. This study aims to investigate sex differences in extent of cardiac damage (CD) from pressure overload in AS that may help account for the observed disparities. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: CD in AS refers to a series of pathologic changes in the myocardium that occur due to chronic pressure overload imposed on the left ventricle by a progressively stenotic aortic valve (AV). These changes are associated with poor outcomes and lower survival in patients with AS. To acquire a deeper understanding of the factors and mechanisms affecting differences in the long-term survival and management of patients with AS, we are proposing to assess baseline stage of CD on echocardiography, and changes in transvalvular hemodynamics and CD stage (CD) over time, in patients with moderate and severe AS at one of 2 large tertiary-care hospitals in MA. We also plan to assess time to and performance of aortic valve replacement (AVR), stratified by hemodynamic severity of stenosis and CD stage, and their interaction with sex. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: We hypothesize that women will have a higher stage of CD on their initial echocardiogram (TTE), demonstrating moderate or greater severity of AS, than men with the same hemodynamic severity of valvular stenosis. We additionally hypothesize that those with more advanced cardiac damage stage will likely have masking of transvalvular progression on echocardiogram. Finally, we anticipate that women will have AVR performed less frequently than men and will have minimal improvement in their Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) scores post-AVR indicative of more heart failure symptoms and a lower quality of life. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE: This study will seek to better understand sex-based differences in extent of cardiac damage to pressure overload in aortic stenosis (AS) to minimize treatment and outcome disparities for women and allow for more individualized and patient-centered care.

AB  - In this study, we compare gender-specific clinical outcomes. We show that outcomes among women after transcatheter aortic valve implantation are significantly influenced by co-existing coronary artery disease (CAD) and its complexity, whereas in men, this is less pronounced. Moreover, we identified a subgroup of women with complex CAD who are at particularly high risk for fatal cardiovascular events, even when compared with men with similar CAD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) has been increasingly used for the treatment of descending thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections. This study sought to evaluate the influence of sex on outcomes after TEVAR. METHODS AND RESULTS: This was an observational study from the Nationwide Readmissions Database analyzing all patients who underwent TEVAR from 2010 to 2018. Sampling weights were used to generate national estimates. International Classification of Diseases–Clinical Modification codes were used to identify patients with thoracic aortic aneurysms or dissections who underwent TEVAR. Patients were dichotomized according to sex, and 1:1 propensity score matching was applied. Mixed model regression for in-hospital mortality and weighted logistic regression with bootstrapping for 30-day readmissions were performed. A supplemental analysis was performed according to pathology (aneurysm or dissection). A weighted total of 27 118 patients were identified. Propensity-matching yielded 5026 risk-adjusted pairs. Men were more likely to undergo TEVAR for type B aortic dissection, whereas women were more likely to undergo TEVAR for aneurysm. In-hospital mortality was roughly 5% and was equivalent in the matched groups. Men were more likely to have paraplegia, acute kidney injury, and arrhythmias, while women were more likely to require transfusions after TEVAR. There were no significant differences in myocardial infarction, heart failure, respiratory failure, spinal cord ischemia, mesenteric ischemia, stroke, or 30-day readmission between the matched groups. On regression analysis, sex was not an independent risk factor for in-hospital mortality. Female sex was, however, significantly associated with a decreased odds of 30-day readmission (odds ratio, 0.90 [95% CI, 0.87–0.92]; P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Women are more likely to undergo TEVAR for aneurysms, while men are more likely to undergo TEVAR for type B aortic dissection. In-hospital mortality after TEVAR is comparable among men and women irrespective of indication. Female sex is independently associated with a reduced odds of 30-day readmission after TEVAR.

AB  - Background Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is a reasonable strategy among patients with severe aortic stenosis irrespective of surgical risk. Data regarding sex-specific differences in the outcomes with newer generation valves are limited. Methods Electronic databases were searched for studies assessing sex differences in the outcomes of patients treated with TAVR with newer generation valves (SAPIEN 3 or Evolut). Random effects model was utilized for summary estimates. Results Four observational studies with 4,522 patients (44.8% women) were included in the meta-analysis. Women were older and had a lower prevalence of coronary disease and mean STS/EuroScore. Women had higher incidence of short-term mortality (up to 30 days) (risk ratio [RR] 1.60, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.14-2.25), but no difference in long-term mortality (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.72-1.17). There was no significant difference in the incidence of major bleeding (RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.86-1.57), permanent pacemaker (PPM) (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.62- 1.04) or disabling stroke (RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.54-2.45) (Figure 1). Conclusion In this meta-analysis, we found that women undergoing TAVR with newer generation devices were older and had lower prevalence of co-morbidities. Women had a higher incidence of short-term mortality but no difference in the long-term mortality, bleeding, PPM, or stroke compared with men. Future studies are required to confirm these findings.

T2  - Journal of the American College of Cardiology
AB  - Background Increasing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) rates have resulted in prolonged waiting times. These have been associated with heart failure hospitalisations (HFH) and mortality yet sex differences have not yet been reported. Methods All patients who underwent TAVI for severe aortic stenosis at a tertiary referral hospital in Melbourne, Australia were prospectively included. Total waiting time was divided into ‘work-up’ waiting time (period from referral date until approval at the multidisciplinary heart team (MDT) meeting) and, ‘procedural’ waiting time (period from MDT meeting approval to procedure date). Patients were analysed according to sex. Cohorts were matched to correct for differences in baseline and procedural variables. The primary endpoint was total waiting time and its two composites. Secondary outcomes included a composite of 30-day and 1-year mortality and HFH, quality of life and mobility. Results A total of 407 patients (42% women) were included. After matching of the two cohorts (345 patients), women had significantly longer total waiting times than men (figure). Increasing waiting times correlated with higher 30-day mortality and HFH (p=0.01 for work-up waiting time, p=0.02 for procedural waiting time) and decreased 30-day mobility (p=0.044 for procedural waiting time) in women but not in men. Conclusion TAVI waiting times are significantly longer in women compared to men and correlate with increased mortality and HFH and reduced mobility at 30-days. [Formula presented]

AB  - Aims The impact of sexuality in patients with significant tricuspid regurgitation (TR) undergoing transcatheter tricuspid valve intervention (TTVI) is unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate sex-specific outcomes in patients with significant TR treated with TTVI vs. medical therapy alone Methods The Transcatheter Tricuspid Valve Therapies (TriValve) registry collected data on patients with significant TR from 24 cen- and results tres who underwent TTVI from 2016 to 2021. A control cohort was formed by medically managed patients with ≥severe isolated TR diagnosed in 2015–18. The primary endpoint was freedom from all-cause mortality. Secondary endpoints were heart failure (HF) hospitalization, New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional status, and TR severity. One-year outcomes were assessed for the TriValve cohort and compared with the control cohort with the inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW). A total of 556 and 2072 patients were included from the TriValve and control groups, respectively. After TTVI, there was no difference between women and men in 1-year freedom from all-cause mortality 80.9% vs. 77.9%, P = 0.56, nor in HF hospitalization (P = 0.36), NYHA Functional Classes III and IV (P = 0.17), and TR severity >2+ at last follow-up (P = 0.42). Multivariable Cox-regression weighted by IPTW showed improved 1-year survival after TTVI compared with medical therapy alone in both women (adjusted hazard ratio 0.45, 95% confidence interval 0.23–0.83, P = 0.01) and men (adjusted hazard ratio 0.42, 95% confidence interval 0.18–0.89, P = 0.03) Conclusion After TTVI in high-risk patients, there were no sex-related differences in terms of survival, HF hospitalization, functional status, and TR reduction up to 1 year. The IPTW analysis shows a survival benefit of TTVI over medical therapy alone in both women and men.

AB  - Purpose of reviewAcute aortic syndromes include acute aortic dissection, intramural hematoma, and penetrating aortic ulcer, and are associated with high mortality and morbidity. This review focuses on recent findings and current understanding of gender-related and sex-related differences in acute aortic syndromes.Recent findingsLarge international and national registries, population studies, and multicentre national prospective cohort studies show evidence of sex differences in acute aortic syndromes. Recent studies of risk factors, aorta remodelling, and genetics provide possible biological basis for sex differences. The 2022 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Aortic Disease revise recommendations for surgical management for aortic root and ascending aorta dilatation, which could impact outcome differences between the sexes.SummaryAcute aortic syndromes affect men more frequently than women. The prevalence of acute aortic syndromes and prevalence of many risk factors rise sharply with age in women leading to higher age at presentation for women. Times from symptom onset to presentation and presentation to diagnosis are delayed in female patients. Females with type A dissection are also more commonly treated conservatively than male counterparts. These factors likely contribute to higher early mortality and complications in women.

AB  - Pressure overload in patients with aortic valve stenosis and volume overload in mitral valve regurgitation trigger specific forms of cardiac remodeling; however, little is known about similarities and differences in myocardial proteome regulation. We performed proteome profiling of 75 human left ventricular myocardial biopsies (aortic stenosis = 41, mitral regurgitation = 17, and controls = 17) using high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry next to clinical and hemodynamic parameter acquisition. In patients of both disease groups, proteins related to ECM and cytoskeleton were more abundant, whereas those related to energy metabolism and proteostasis were less abundant compared with controls. In addition, disease group-specific and sex-specific differences have been observed. Male patients with aortic stenosis showed more proteins related to fibrosis and less to energy metabolism, whereas female patients showed strong reduction in proteostasis-related proteins. Clinical imaging was in line with proteomic findings, showing elevation of fibrosis in both patient groups and sex differences. Disease- and sex-specific proteomic profiles provide insight into cardiac remodeling in patients with heart valve disease and might help improve the understanding of molecular mechanisms and the development of individualized treatment strategies.

AB  - Background: We aimed to test the differences in peak VO2 between males and females in patients diagnosed with heart failure (HF), using combined stress echocardiography (SE) and cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET). Methods: Patients who underwent CPET and SE for evaluation of dyspnea or exertional intolerance at our institution, between January 2013 and December 2017, were included and retrospectively assessed. Patients were divided into three groups: HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), HF with mildly reduced or reduced ejection fraction (HFmrEF/HFrEF), and patients without HF (control). These groups were further stratified by sex. Results: One hundred seventy-eight patients underwent CPET-SE testing, of which 40% were females. Females diagnosed with HFpEF showed attenuated increases in end diastolic volume index (P = 0.040 for sex × time interaction), significantly elevated E/e' (P < 0.001), significantly decreased left ventricle (LV) end diastolic volume:E/e ratio (P = 0.040 for sex × time interaction), and lesser increases in A-VO2 difference (P = 0.003 for sex × time interaction), comparing to males with HFpEF. Females diagnosed with HFmrEF/HFrEF showed diminished increases in end diastolic volume index (P = 0.050 for sex × time interaction), mostly after anaerobic threshold was met, comparing to males with HFmrEF/HFrEF. This resulted in reduced increases in peak stroke volume index (P = 0.010 for sex × time interaction) and cardiac output (P = 0.050 for sex × time interaction). Conclusions: Combined CPET-SE testing allows for individualized non-invasive evaluation of exercise physiology stratified by sex. Female patients with HF have lower exercise capacity compared to men with HF. For females diagnosed with HFpEF, this was due to poorer LV compliance and attenuated peripheral oxygen extraction, while for females diagnosed with HFmrEF/HFrEF, this was due to attenuated increase in peak stroke volume and cardiac output. As past studies have shown differences in clinical outcomes between females and males, this study provides an essential understanding of the differences in exercise physiology in HF patients, which may improve patient selection for targeted therapeutics.

AB  - Objectives: To evaluate sex differences in in-hospital mortality and 90-day readmission rates among patients undergoing transcatheter mitral valve replacement (TMVR) in the United States of America. Background: Women have higher rates of mortality and rehospitalization than men following many cardiac procedures. TMVR has grown as an alternative to mitral valve surgery for patients at high surgical risk. The rates of TMVR mortality and rehospitalization by sex are unknown. Methods: We analyzed the Nationwide Readmissions Database (NRD) from 2016 to 2019 to identify hospitalizations for TMVR. Sex differences in in-hospital mortality and 90-day readmissions were determined using logistic regression models. Results: Between 2016 and 2019, 4109 hospitalizations for TMVR were identified, comprised of 1758 (42.8%) men and 2351 (57.2%) women. The median age was 74 years for both men and women. There was no significant difference in in-hospital mortality during index hospitalization (6.51% vs. 6.69%; p = 0.852) and all-cause 90-day readmission (28.19% vs. 29.59%; p = 0.563) between men and women. Across the study period, trend analysis did not reveal a significant change in in-hospital mortality (men p = 0.087, women p = 0.194) or 90-day readmission rates (men p = 0.569, women p = 0.454). Conclusions: In patients undergoing TMVR, in-hospital mortality and 90-day readmissions are similar between men and women. Between 2016 and 2019, TMVR in-hospital mortality and 90-day readmission rates remained unchanged. Further research is necessary to confirm these findings.

AB  - Introduction: It is a matter of controversy whether the therapeutic strategy for severe aortic stenosis (AS) differs according to gender. Methods: Retrospective study of patients diagnosed with severe AS (transvalvular mean gradient ≥ 40 mmHg and/or aortic valvular area < 1 cm2) between 2009 and 2019. Our aim was to assess the association of sex on AVR or medical management and outcomes in patients with severe AS. Results: 452 patients were included. Women (51.1%) were older than men (80 ± 8.4 vs. 75.8 ± 9.9 years; p < 0.001). Aortic valve replacement (AVR) was performed less frequently in women (43.4% vs. 53.2%; p = 0.03), but multivariate analyses showed that sex was not an independent predictor factor for AVR. Age, Charlson index and symptoms were predictive factors (OR 0.81 [0.82–0.89], OR 0.81 [0.71–0.93], OR 22.02 [6.77–71.64]). Survival analysis revealed no significant association of sex within all-cause and cardiovascular mortalities (log-rank p = 0.63 and p = 0.07). Cox proportional hazards analyses showed AVR (HR: 0.1 [0.06–0.15]), Charlson index (HR: 1.13 [1.06–1.21]) and reduced LVEF (HR: 1.9 [1.32–2.73]) to be independent cardiovascular mortality predictors. Conclusions: Gender is not associated with AVR or long-term prognosis. Cardiovascular mortality was associated with older age, more comorbidity and worse LVEF.

AB  - Background: The pathophysiological role of angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis in aortic stenosis (AS) remains unknown. Valve avascularity is seemly abrogated in AS and neovascularization is wellcorrelated with the disease(1,2). We study sex-related differences in angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis in aortic valves (AVs) and valve interstitial cells (VICs) from AS patients. Methods: 226 patients recruited (60.6% men) with severe AS undergoing surgical valve replacement. Results: The density of total neovessels was higher in AVs from men versus women's. Small and medium neovessels were more abundant in men's AVs. Male AVs exhibited enhanced CD31 and VE-cadherin expressions. Levels of the pro-angiogenic markers [vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A, VEGF receptor (VEGFR)1, VEGFR2, insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-2 (IGFBP-2), interleukin (IL)-8, chemerin and fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-7] were increased in men's AVs. Transforming growth factor-β expression was higher in male AVs. Expression of antiangiogenic molecules [thrombospondin (Tsp)-1, endostatin and CD36] was upregulated in male AVs, although the levels of Tsp-2, IL-4, IL-12p70 and chondromodulin-1 were similar between sexes. The number of lymphatic vessels and the expression of the lymphangiogenic markers Lyve-1 and D2-40 was enhanced in men's AV also VEGF-C, VEGF-D and VEGFR3. VICs isolated from men's AVs secreted higher amounts of pro-angiogenic (VEGF-A, VEGFR1, IGFBP-2 and FGF-7) and pro-lymphangiogenic factors (VEGF-C, VEGFD and VEGFR3) than women's without changes in antiangiogenic markers. Conclusions: We show that aberrant angiogenic and lymphangiogenic cues are over-represented in male AVs. VICs are a relevant source of multiple morphogens involved in angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis likely endowing the AV of men with the predominant calcific AS phenotypes (3,4).

AB  - Few researchers have discussed the differences in gender between the age groups of patients who underwent transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). We searched the National Readmissions Database from 2012 to 2019 to identify adults who underwent TAVI. We studied hospital outcomes and short- to medium-term outcomes by age stratification (18 to 59, 60 to 69, 70 to 79, and 80 to 90 years) after TAVI and categorized by gender. We included 147,481 patients who underwent TAVI, and 54,802 pairs were matched using propensity score matching separately for each age group. Compared with men, women in all age groups had a similar rate of hospital death. Except the 18- to 59-year-old groups, female patients were less likely to undergo permanent pacemaker implantation and transfusion. Records of readmission at 30 days and 6 months were used as the follow-up outcome according to the presence or absence of readmission. Major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) were a composite of cardiovascular readmission, all-cause mortality during readmission, and stroke readmission. At the 30-day follow-up visit, there was no difference in the all-cause readmission and MACE between women and men in any group. At the 6-month follow-up visit, women in the 70- to 79-year-old and 80- to 90-year-old groups had a high risk of all-cause readmission. In conclusion, we reported that female patients have similar in-hospital death rates to male patients who underwent TAVI. During the 30-day follow-up visit, the all-cause readmission and MACE were not different in all age groups between men and women. At 6 months, women in the 70- to 79-year-old and 80- to 90-year-old groups had a higher risk of all-cause readmission.

AB  - Background: Although outcomes in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) undergoing primary percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) have improved, women show higher mortality. Objectives: To assess gender differences in presentation, management and in-hospital mortality, at 30-days, 6-months and 1-year after STEMI. Methods: We retrospectively collected data from 809 consecutive patients treated with primary PCI and compared the females versus males at the local intervention cardiology database. The level of significance used was p<0.05. Results: Women were older than man (69,1±14,6 vs. 58,5±12,7 years; p<.001) with higher prevalence of age over 75 years (36.7% vs. 11.7%; p<.001), diabetes (30,6% vs. 18,5%; p=.001), hypertension (60.5% vs. 45.9%; p=.001), chronic kidney disease (3.4% vs. 0.6%; p=.010) and acute ischemic stroke (6.8% vs. 3.0%; p=.021). At presentation, women had more atypical symptoms, less chest pain (p=.014) and were more frequently in cardiogenic shock (p=.011)). Women had longer time until reperfusion (p=.001) and were less likely to receive optimal medical therapy (p<0.05). In-hospital mortality (p=.001), at 30-days (p<.001), 6-months (p<.001) and 1-year (16.4% vs. p<.001) was higher in women. The multivariate analysis identified age over 75 years (HR=4.25; 95% CI[1.67-10.77];p=.002), Killip class II (HR=8.80; 95% CI[2.72-28.41];p<.001), III (HR=5.88; 95% CI [0.99-34.80]; p=.051) and IV (HR=9.60; 95% CI[1.86-48.59];p=.007), Acute Kidney Injury (HR=2.47; 95% CI[1.00-6.13];p=.051) and days of hospitalization (HR=1.04; 95% CI[1.01-1.08];p=.030) but not female gender (HR=0.83; 95% CI[0.33-2.10];p=.690) as independent prognostic factors of mortality. Conclusions: Compared to men, women with STEMI undergoing primary PCI have higher mortality rates. Women admitted for STEMI have a worse risk profile, are treated with a higher reperfusion time related with system delays and are less likely to receive the recommended therapy. Female gender was not an independent prognostic factor for mortality in the studied population.

T2  - Annals of Noninvasive Electrocardiology
AB  - Background: Early post-operative atrial fibrillation (EPOAF) occurs more frequently in male (M) patients. However, most patients included in EPOAF studies were also M. The aim of the present study was to compare, in a matched M and F population, the occurrence of EPOAF episodes and EPOAF characteristics using continuous rhythm monitoring (CRM) during the first five post-operative days. Methods: Our study population consisted of 30 F patients matched with 30 M patients admitted for elective cardiac surgery. After cardiac surgery, patients were continuously monitored for a maximum of 5 days, and the burden of EPOAF episodes was quantified. Results: No significant differences in the onset, number, burden, total duration, shortest, median and longest EPOAF episode were detected between M and F patients. However, EPOAF occurred more frequently on the third post-operative day (F: 16 vs. M: 7; p =.013). Conclusions: Except for the occurrence of the EPOAF on the third post-operative day. EPOAF characteristics did not differ between M and F patients.

AB  - Aim: Although some sex differences in stroke have been reported, differences in the effects of antiplatelet therapy for secondary stroke prevention have not been clarified. Methods: In the Cilostazol Stroke Prevention Study combination trial, patients with high-risk, non-cardioembolic ischemic stroke between 8 and 180 days after onset treated with aspirin or clopidogrel alone were recruited and randomly assigned to receive either monotherapy or dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) using cilostazol and followed up for 0.5–3.5 years. The primary efficacy outcome was recurrence of ischemic stroke. The safety outcome was severe or life-threatening hemorrhage. Outcomes were analyzed by sex. Results: A total of 1,320 male patients and 558 female patients were included. The male patients had more risk factors than the female patients. In male patients, the primary endpoint occurred at a rate of 2.0 per 100 patient-years in the DAPT group and 5.1 per 100 patient-years in the monotherapy group (hazard ratio (HR), 0.40; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.23–0.68). In male patients, DAPT prolonged the time to recurrent stroke by 4.02-fold (95% CI, 1.63–9.96) compared with monotherapy. In female patients, the average annual event rates were 2.7 per 100 patient-years in the DAPT group and 3.3 per 100 patient-years in the monotherapy group (HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.37–1.84). Safety outcomes did not differ significantly in both male and female patients. Conclusions: Long-term DAPT using cilostazol reduced the recurrence of ischemic stroke and prolonged the recurrence-free time in male patients, but not in female patients.

AB  - Background: The pathophysiology of atherosclerotic plaque formation and its vulnerability seem to differ between genders due to contrasting risk profiles and sex hormones, however this process is still insufficiently understood. The aim of the study was to compare the differences between sexes regarding the optical coherence tomography (OCT), intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) and fractional flow reserve (FFR)-derived coronary plaque indices. Methods: In this single-center multimodality imaging study patients with intermediate grade coronary stenoses identified in coronary angiogram (CAG) were evaluated using OCT, IVUS and FFR. Stenoses were considered significant when the FFR value was ≤0.8. Minimal lumen area (MLA), was analyzed by OCT in addition to plaque stratification into fibrotic, calcific, lipidic and thin-cap fibroatheroma (TCFA). IVUS was used for evaluation of lumen-, plaque- and vessel volume, as well as plaque burden. Results: A total of 112 patients (88 men and 24 women) with chronic coronary syndromes (CCS), who underwent CAG were enrolled. No significant differences in baseline characteristics were present between the study groups. The mean FFR was 0.76 (0.73–0.86) in women and 0.78 ± 0.12 in men (p = 0.695). OCT evaluation showed a higher prevalence of calcific plaques among women than men p = 0.002 whereas lipid plaques were more frequent in men (p = 0.04). No significant differences regarding minimal lumen diameter and minimal lumen area were found between the sexes. In IVUS analysis women presented with significantly smaller vessel area, plaque area, plaque volume, vessel volume (11.1 ± 3.3 mm2 vs. 15.0 ± 4.6 mm2 p = 0.001, 6.04 ± 1.7 mm2 vs. 9.24 ± 2.89 mm2 p < 0.001, 59.8 ± 35.2 mm3 vs. 96.3 (52.5–159.1) mm3 p = 0.005, 106.9 ± 59.8 mm3 vs. 153.3 (103–253.4) mm3 p = 0.015 respectively). At MLA site plaque burden was significantly greater for men than women (61.50 ± 7.7% vs. 55.5 ± 8.0% p = 0.005). Survival did not differ significantly between women and men (94.6 ± 41.9 months and 103.51 ± 36.7 months respectively; p = 0.187). Conclusion: The presented study did not demonstrate significant differences in FFR values between women and men, yet a higher prevalence of calcific plaques by OCT and lower plaque burden at the MLA site by IVUS was found in women vs. men.

T2  - International Journal of Cardiovascular Sciences
AB  - Sex is an important biological variable in the pathophysiology of cardiovascular disease. , In fact, it could determine great differences in manifestation, treatment, and outcomes of several heart disorders. At the level of the aortic valve, there are sex-specific factors related to the pathogenesis of aortic stenosis (AS) that influence hemodynamics changes resulting from pressure overload response, and they should be considered in the management of patients. Despite the fact that sex-based differences in AS exist, they are often not fully recognized and understood, leading to unequal treatment outcomes between males and females.This issue of the International Journal of Cardiovascular Sciences presents a comprehensive review of the growing evidence on sex disparities, from the pathogenesis to the treatment of severe degenerative AS, focusing on women.

T2  - Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine
AB  - This review gives an overview of sex-based differences in aortic valve stenosis, spanning from pathophysiological mechanisms and disease progression, clinical presentation, presence of comorbidities, and diagnostic assessment, to treatment and outcomes. In particular, sex-related differences in the degree of aortic valve calcification, the response of the left ventricle to pressure overload, as well as in the referral to procedures, with women being less frequently referred for surgical aortic valve replacement and experiencing longer waiting times for transcatheter procedures, will be discussed. Sex-related differences are also particularly evident in outcomes of patients with severe aortic stenosis undergoing surgical or transcatheter procedures. The apparent sex paradox seen in women undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation refers to the phenomenon of women experiencing higher rates of short-term mortality and bleeding events, but demonstrating improved long-term survival as compared to men. Women who undergo surgical aortic valve replacement have generally worse outcomes as compared to men, which is reflected by the inclusion of female sex in surgical risk calculation scores. Hence, a thorough understanding of sex-related differences in aortic valve stenosis is important to provide optimal and personalized patient care.

AB  - The number of structural heart disease interventions has greatly increased in the past decade. Moreover, interest in the sex-specific outcomes of various cardiovascular conditions and procedures has increased. In this review, we discuss the sex differences in the clinical profiles and outcomes of patients undergoing the most commonly performed structural procedures: transcatheter aortic valve replacement, transcatheter edge to edge repair of the mitral and tricuspid valve, transcatheter pulmonary valve replacement, patent foramen ovale closure and left atrial appendage occlusion. We shed light on potential reasons for these differences and emphasize the importance of increasing the representation of women in randomized clinical trials, to understand these differences and support the application of these cutting-edge technologies.

AB  - Available data have demonstrated important sex-related differences in patients with valvular heart disease, regarding clinical presentation, treatment, and outcomes. Although the calcific aortic stenosis (AS) is more frequent in men compared to women, the majority of AS patients over 80 years old are women, in whom fibrotic remodeling of aortic valve is typically found. Mitral valve disease is more common in women. However females are under-referred or delayed referrals to treatment, probably due to the absence of sex-based LV dimension values guiding surgical timing. The development of transcatheter devices have revolutionized the treatment of valvular heart disease and increased the interest in this topic. In this context, the consideration of gender differences in presentation, diagnosis, treatment success, and prognosis is of great importance.

AB  - Introduction: The impact of sex on hospital readmission rate after cardiac surgery is unclear. Therefore, we aimed to analyse sex-specific differences and underlying factors in 30-day readmission rate after cardiac surgery. Methods: We conducted a single center study including all patients after major cardiac surgery (excluding aortic dissection and left ventricular assist device implantation) from January 2012 to September 2020. Reasons for readmission were adjudicated according to all available medical records. We calculated incidence rate ratios (IRR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for female sex with re-admission crude and adjusted for plausible confounding factors using negative binomial regression. Results: 4,868 patients were included in the analysis. The median [Interquartile range] age was 68 [60 to 74] years and 24% (n = 1,149) of the patients were female. Female patients were significantly older (median [IQR] age 70 (63 to 76) vs. 67 (59 to 74), p < 0.001) and had lower body mass index and fewer cardiovascular risk factors compared to men. Isolated valve surgery was more frequent in female while coronary artery bypass grafting was more often in men. 30-day readmission was comparable between both sexes (7.0% [n = 81] in female vs. 8.7% [n = 322] in men; p = 0.078). Cardiac related readmissions and infections were the most common reasons for readmission in both groups. The overall incidence rate ratios of female sex with readmission (0.80, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.03, p = 0.078) remained robust after adjustment for EuroSCORE 2 (0.78, CI 0.61 to 1.0, p = 0.051). Conclusion: Readmission rate and reasons for 30-day readmission after major cardiac surgery were similar between men and women.

AB  - Introduction: Sex differences in the adaptation to pressure overload have been described in humans, as well as animal models, and have been related to sex-specific expression of mitochondrial genes. We therefore tested whether sex differences in cardiac mitochondrial respiration exist in humans with aortic stenosis (AS). We also examined whether these potential differences may be at least partially due to sex hormones by testing if mitochondrial respiration is affected by estrogen (17ß-estradiol (E2)). Methods: Consecutive patients undergoing transapical aortic valve implantation (TAVI) (women, n = 7; men, n = 10) were included. Cardiac biopsies were obtained during TAVI and used directly for mitochondrial function measurements. Male and female C57BL/6J mice (n = 8/group) underwent sham surgery or gonadectomy (GDX) at the age of 2 months. After 14 days, mice were treated once with intraperitoneally injected vehicle (placebo), 17ß-estradiol (E2), estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) agonist [propyl pyrazole triol (PPT)], or ER beta (ERβ) agonist (BAY-1214257). Thereafter, mitochondrial measurements were performed directly in cardiac skinned fibers from isolated left ventricles and musculus solei. Results: Mitochondrial State-3 respiration was higher in female than that in male human heart biopsies (15.0 ± 2.30 vs. 10.3 ± 2.05 nmol/mL/min/mg, p< 0.05). In the mouse model, mitochondrial State-3 respiration decreased significantly after GDX in female (27.6 ± 1.55 vs. 21.4 ± 1.71 nmol/mL/min/mg; p< 0.05) and male hearts (30.7 ± 1,48 vs. 23.7 ± 2,23 nmol/mL/min/mg; p< 0.05). In ovariectomized female mice, E2 and ERβ-agonist treatment restored the State-3 respiration to intact placebo level, whereas ERα-agonist treatment did not modulate State-3 respiration. The treatment with E2, ERα-, or ERβ-agonist did not modulate the State-3 respiration in GDX male mice. Conclusion: We identified sex differences in mitochondrial respiration in the diseased human heart. This is in alignment with known sex differences in the gene expression and proteome level at the functional level. E2 and ERβ affect cardiac mitochondrial function in the mouse model, suggesting that they may also contribute to the sex differences in the human heart. Their roles should be further investigated.

AB  - Background/Introduction: It has been suggested that the complexity of CAD is a determinant of worse outcomes after TAVI. However, no data shows this equally applies to both sexes. Purpose: Males are usually overrepresented in studies regarding CAD and care should be used when translating these results: to the female population. The purpose: of this analysis was to compare sex specific clinical outcomes Methods: All patients undergoing TAVI at a tertiary referral centre between 2008 and 2020 were included and outcomes up to 5 years were prospectively recorded. Baseline and residual SYNTAX-scores (SS) were calculated to make groups of different CAD complexity. Results: Of the 604 patients, 284 (47%) were women. There were some interesting differences between males and females (Table 1). Five years after TAVR, women and men had similar overall survival (62 vs 59%, p=0.320) and cardiovascular mortality (22% vs 20%, p=0.540), respectively. In contrast with men, women showed worse survival and cardiovascular mortality with increasing CAD complexity (Figure 1(Panels A-D)). Moreover, women with complex CAD showed a trend towards worse cardiovascular survival after 5 years when compared with men (40% vs 21%, p=0.087) (Figure 1(E)). This difference seems not to be driven by a lower rate of revascularization since women with CAD received significantly more PCI (41% vs 24%, p=0.001) and trended towards more complete revascularization (residual SS <8 70% in women vs 52% in men, p=0.054). Furthermore, background medical therapy was not different (Table 1). When men and women that received reasonably complete revascularization were compared, there was a non-significant trend towards lower cardiovascular mortality for the females (15% vs 48%, p=0.069) (Figure 1(F)). Conclusions: In contrast with an accepted restrictive approach towards revascularization at the time of TAVI, women undergoing TAVI require enhanced attention towards the treatment of CAD, primarily with optimisation of medical treatment and potentially complemented with (complete) revascularization whenever feasible, particularly in complex CAD.

AB  - There is strong evidence that sex chromosomes and sex hormones influence blood pressure (BP) regulation, distribution of cardiovascular (CV) risk factors and co-morbidities differentially in females and males with essential arterial hypertension. The risk for CV disease increases at a lower BP level in females than in males, suggesting that sex-specific thresholds for diagnosis of hypertension may be reasonable. However, due to paucity of data, in particularly from specifically designed clinical trials, it is not yet known whether hypertension should be differently managed in females and males, including treatment goals and choice and dosages of antihypertensive drugs. Accordingly, this consensus document was conceived to provide a comprehensive overview of current knowledge on sex differences in essential hypertension including BP development over the life course, development of hypertension, pathophysiologic mechanisms regulating BP, interaction of BP with CV risk factors and co-morbidities, hypertension-mediated organ damage in the heart and the arteries, impact on incident CV disease, and differences in the effect of antihypertensive treatment. The consensus document also highlights areas where focused research is needed to advance sex-specific prevention and management of hypertension.

AB  - Deep sternal wound infection (DSWI) is a feared complication after cardiac surgery. The impact of sex-related differences on wound infection prevalence is poorly understood. Our aim was to evaluate the effect of sex on short-term outcomes in patients with DSWI after open-heart surgery. The study was a retrospective cohort study. A total of 217 patients with DSWI were identified and retrospectively analyzed using our institutional database. Patients were divided into two groups: males (n = 150) and females (n = 67). This study also includes a propensity score based matching (PSM) analysis (male group (n = 62) and female group (n = 62)) to examine the unequal groups. Mean age (p = 0.088) and mean body mass index (BMI) (p = 0.905) did not significantly differ between both groups. Vacuum assisted closure (VAC) therapy was performed among most patients (82.3% (male group) vs. 83.9% (female group), p = 0.432). The most commonly isolated bacteria from the wounds were Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus in both groups. Acute renal failure was significantly higher (p = 0.010) in the male group compared to the female group. However, dialysis rate did not significantly differ (p = 0.491) between male and female groups. Further secondary outcomes showed no major differences between the groups. Likewise, in-hospital mortality rate did not differ significantly (p = 0.680) between both groups. Based on our data, sex has no impact on deep wound infection prevalence after cardiac surgery.

AB  - Background: We performed a nationwide population-based cohort study to investigate sex differences in the rate of permanent pacemaker implantation after surgical aortic valve replacement (AVR). Methods: This study included all adult patients who underwent primary AVR in Sweden between 2005 and 2018. Study data were obtained from the Swedish Web system for Enhancement and Development of Evidence-based care in Heart disease Evaluated According to Recommended Therapies (SWEDEHEART) registry and other Swedish national health-data registers. The rate of permanent pacemaker implantation within 30 days of surgery AVR was compared between men and women. We estimated propensity scores that were used for inverse probability of treatment weighting to account for sex differences in patient characteristics. Results: A total of 18 131 patients were included, 11 657 men (64%) and 6474 women (36%). The rate of permanent pacemaker implantation did not differ between women (3.8%; 95% CI, 3.2%-4.3%) and men (3.7%; 95% CI, 3.3%-4.1%; P = .831). In patients aged <60 years, the rate of permanent pacemaker implantation was significantly higher in women (6.2%; 95% CI, 4.3%-8.0%) than in men (3.6%; 95% CI, 2.8%-4.4%; P = .006). The odds of pacemaker implantation in patients aged <60 years was significantly higher in women (odds ratio, 1.76; 95% CI, 1.17-2.63; P = .006). In patients aged 60 to 79 years and ≥80 years, the rate of pacemaker implantation did not differ between men and women. Conclusions: The rate of permanent pacemaker implantation after surgical AVR in patients aged <60 years was higher in women than in men. The susceptibility to conduction disturbances requiring permanent pacemaker implantation in women aged <60 years warrants further investigation and should be recognized as transcatheter aortic valve replacement expands into younger patients.

AB  - Background: We aimed to study sex differences in aortopathy and valve disease among patients undergoing aortic valve replacement and/or surgical procedure for ascending aortic aneurysm and assess whether differences are specific for patients with bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) compared with patients with tricuspid aortic valve. Methods: We used a single-center and observational cohort including 1045 patients undergoing elective open heart surgical procedure for aortic valve disease and/or ascending aortic aneurysm at the Karolinska Hospital (Stockholm, Sweden). Results: Women (33.0%) were older than men (mean [SD]; 67.9 [11] years vs 62.5 [13] years for men; P < .001). No significant sex difference in prevalence of ascending aortic aneurysm was found according to absolute measures (P = .19); however, women had a greater dilation of the ascending aorta when normalized for body surface area (mean, 21.8 [SD, 6.3] mm/m2 vs 19.3 [SD, 4.4] mm/m2 for men; P < .001). Among the 560 patients with BAV, women had significantly more aortic stenosis (adjusted odds ratio, 2.23; 95% CI, 1.19-4.20; P = .013) and less aortic insufficiency (adjusted odds ratio, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.23-0.78; P < .01); whereas no sex difference was found among patients with tricuspid aortic valve. Conclusions: In this large study of patients undergoing cardiac surgical procedure, we found a greater degree of aortic dilation in women compared with men, suggesting a need for earlier monitoring of women. Moreover, women with BAV had a significantly higher prevalence of aortic stenosis compared with men. These results describe the aorta and valvular characteristics of patients by sex and provide guidance regarding which patients might benefit from closer surveillance.

AB  - Several studies have shown an association between aortic stenosis (AS) and coronary atherosclerosis. This study aimed to evaluate the gender differences in aortic valve calcium (AVC) and coronary artery calcium (CAC) and the association between CAC and all-cause mortality in patients with severe AS. A total of 260 patients (80 ± 7 years, 39% men) with severe AS who were scheduled for transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) were included. AVC and CAC before TAVI were assessed by noncontrast cardiac computed tomography. Patients with coronary intervention or aortic valve replacement before cardiac computed tomography were excluded. Standard reference values of CAC score were used to classify the percentile groups and the distribution of AVC was assessed. The primary end point was all-cause mortality. In men, the AVC score was 3,911 Hounsfield units (HUs) (interquartile range [IQR] 2,525 to 5,259) and in women, 2,409 HU (IQR 1,588 to 3,359) (p <0.001). CAC score in men was 824 HU (IQR 328 to 1,855) and in women, 478 HU (IQR 136 to 962) (p <0.001). In men, the AVC score increased along with the CAC score, whereas in women, the AVC score was similar across the CAC percentile groups. During a median follow-up of 1,095 days, 59 patients (23%) died. No significant gender-difference was seen in all-cause mortality for CAC score (p = 0.187). Men with severe AS show higher AVC and CAC scores than women. Although the pattern of CAC distribution was similar between men and women, the AVC score increased along with the CAC score in men; whereas, in women, the AVC score remained similar across the various percentiles. CAC score was not associated with cumulative mortality in patients with severe AS who underwent TAVI.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiac valvular disease affects millions of people worldwide and is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Female patients have been shown to experience inferior clinical outcomes after nonvalvular cardiac surgery, but recent data are limited regarding open valve surgical cohorts. The primary objective of our study was to assess whether female sex is associated with increased in-hospital mortality after open cardiac valve operations. METHODS: Utilizing the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) State Inpatient Databases (SID), we conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients who underwent open cardiac valve surgery from 2007 to 2018 in Washington, Maryland, Kentucky, and Florida; from 2007 to 2011 in California; and from 2007 to 2016 in New York. The primary objective of this study was to estimate the confounder-adjusted association between sex and in-hospital mortality (as recorded and coded by SID HCUP) after open cardiac valve surgery. We used multilevel multivariable models to account for potential confounders, including intrahospital practice patterns. RESULTS: A total of 272,954 patients (108,443 women; 39.73% of sample population with mean age of 67.6 ± 14.3 years) were included in our analysis. The overall mortality rates were 3.8% for male patients and 5.1% for female patients. The confounder-adjusted odds ratio (OR) for in-hospital mortality for female patients compared to male patients was 1.41 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.35–1.47; P < .001). When stratifying by surgical type, female patients were also at increased odds of in-hospital mortality (P < .001) in populations undergoing aortic valve replacement (adjusted OR [aOR], 1.38; 95% CI, 1.25–1.52); multiple valve surgery (aOR, 1.38; 95% CI,1.22–1.57); mitral valve replacement (aOR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.12–1.34); and valve surgery with coronary artery bypass grafting (aOR, 1.64; 95% CI, 1.54–1.74; all P < .001). Female patients did not have increased odds of in-hospital mortality in populations undergoing mitral valve repair (aOR, 1.26; 95% CI, 0.98–1.64; P = .075); aortic valve repair (aOR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.67–1.14; P = .32); or any other single valve repair (aOR, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.82–1.46; P = .53). CONCLUSIONS: We found an association between female patients and increased confounder-adjusted odds of in-hospital mortality after open cardiac valve surgery. More research is needed to better understand and categorize these important outcome differences. Future research should include observational analysis containing granular and complete patient- and surgery-specific data.

AB  - Background: The impact of nodular calcifications in left ventricular outlow tract (LVOT) and aortic annulus on the procedural outcome of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) with new-generation devices is yet to be elucidated. Similarly, computational simulations may provide a novel insight into the biomechanical features of TAVI devices and their interaction with nodular calcifications. Methods: This retrospective single-center study included 232 patients submitted to TAVI with Evolut-R (53.4%), Portico (33.6%) and Lotus (13.0%) devices with available preoperative computed tomography (CT) angiography and evidence of nodular calcifications in aortic annulus and/or LVOT. Calcification severity was defined ≥moderate in presence of at least two nodules or one nodule ≤5 mm. Three virtual simulation models of aortic root presenting a nodular calcification of increasing size were implemented. Stress distribution, stent-root contact area and paravalvular orifice area were computed. Results: At least moderate calcifications were found in 123 (53.0%) patients, with no sex differences. Among the ≥moderate calcification group, lower device success rate was evident (87.8% vs. 95.4% p = 0.039). Higher rates of ≥moderate paravalvular leak (PVL) (11.4% vs. 3.7% p = 0.028) and vascular complications (9.8% vs. 2.8% p = 0.030) were also observed. Among the Evolut-R group, higher rates of at ≥moderate PVL (12.1%) were observed compared to Portico (3.8% p = 0.045) and Lotus (0.0% p = 0.044) groups. Calcification of both annulus and LVOT (odds ratio [OR] 0.105 p = 0.023) were independent predictors of device success. On computational simulations, Portico exhibited homogeneous stress distribution by increasing calfications and overall a larger paravalvular orifice areas compared to Evolut-R and Lotus. Evolut-R showed higher values of average stress than Portico, although with a more dishomogeneous distribution leading to greater paravalvular orifice areas by severe calcifications. Lotus showed overall small paravalvular orifice areas, with no significant increase across the three models. Conclusions: At least moderate nodular calcifications in the annulus/LVOT region significantly affected TAVI outcome, as they were independent predictors of device success. Lotus and Portico seemed to perform better than Evolut-R as for device success and ≥moderate PVL. Computational simulations revealed unique biomechanical features of the investigated devices in terms of stent compliance and radial force.

AB  - Background: Despite evidence of sex-based divergences in the natural history of aortic stenosis (AS), there is limited data on the sex differences in the hemodynamic progression and long-term outcomes of early-stage AS. Methods: This is a retrospective longitudinal study of patients aged ≥ 60 years with mild to moderate native AS who were identified from a tertiary care referral center between 2008-2016 and followed until 2018. All patients had at minimum 2 echocardiograms. The primary outcomes of all-cause mortality and aortic valve replacement (AVR) were both assessed by time-to-event analyses with multivariable-adjusted Cox regression. The secondary outcome of AS progression was assessed by annualized changes in echocardiographic parameters in a 1:1 propensity-matched group of males and females. Results: Of 2,660 included patients followed over a median duration of 5.6 years, the mean age was 74 years and 1,128 (42%) were female. There was no difference in all-cause mortality between sexes, irrespective of age, baseline AS severity, and receipt of AVR. Relative to males, females had a lower risk of AVR (aHR=0.77, 95% CI [0.65-0.92]; p=0.004) irrespective of age, type of aortic valve and baseline severity of AS (Figure). This finding persisted on sensitivity analyses excluding patients with a history of coronary artery disease, prior coronary bypass surgery (CABG), and who underwent concomitant CABG and AVR. On 1:1 propensity-matched analysis, females had significantly slower annualized decrease in indexed aortic valve area (-0.039 vs. -0.021 cm /m2 /year, p=0.04) and slower increase in mean gradient (1.60 vs. 1.01 mmHg/year, p<0.001),and maximum transvalvular velocity (0.08 vs. 0.11 m/s/year; p=0.04). Conclusion: In patients with mild to moderate AS, females had slower hemodynamic progression of AS and lower incidence of AVR despite similar mortality between sexes. Our findings suggest the need for sex-specific evaluation and management of native AS. (Figure Presented).

AB  - Background: Evidence demonstrated gender disparities after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) with early generation transcatheter heart valves (THV)s. However, it is unclear whether gender-related differences persist with the newer generation THVs. We conducted this meta-analysis and systematic review to assess gender disparities after TAVR with newer generation THVs Methods: We searched MEDLINE, and Embase databases from inception to May 2022 to identify studies that reported gender-specific outcomes after TAVR with newer generation THVs (Sapien 3, Corevalve Evolut R, and Evolut Pro). Outcomes of interests included 30-day mortality, 1-year mortality and vascular complications. Data were pooled using random-effects models to calculate pooled odds ratio (OR) and 95% conference interval (CI). Results: Four studies with a total of 47,933 patients (21,073 in females and 26,860 in males) were included. Ninety-six percent received TAVR via transfemoral approach. Females had higher 30-day mortality (OR = 1.53, 95%CI 1.31-1.79, p-value (p) < 0.001) and vascular complications (OR=1.43, 95%CI 1.23-1.65, p< 0.001). However, 1-year mortality was similar between 2 groups (OR=0.83, 95%CI 0.67-1.04, p=0.33). Conclusions: Higher 30-day mortality after TAVR in females may be attributed from higher vascular complications. Further research is needed to explore potential causes of increased mortality. While vascular complications may be an etiology, other patient characteristics or procedure-related issues should be evaluated. (Figure Presented).

AB  - Introduction: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is now firmly established as an alternative to surgical aortic valve replacement in the treatment of aortic stenosis in all risk groups. Sex differences may influence procedural outcomes. Our study aims to contribute further data on the impact of sex differences on patients who underwent TAVR using a nationally representative sample. Methods: Data were obtained from the combined National Inpatient Sample (NIS) 2016 and 2018. The NIS was searched for hospitalization for TAVR procedure using the ICD-10 PCS codes. Patients undergoing the TAVR procedure were then stratified by sex into male and female sex. Outcomes of interest include in-patient mortality, length of stay (LOS), Total hospital charge (THC), Post procedural complication, pacemaker implantation, cardiogenic shock, ischemic stroke, intraaortic balloon pump insertion, post-procedural infection, and post-procedural kidney disease. Multivariate logistic and linear regression analysis was used accordingly to adjust for possible confounders. Results: There were over 105 million discharges in the combined 2016-2018 NIS database. The database contained hospitalizations for adult patients (aged ≥ 18 years) who were hospitalized for the TAVR procedure. Females had more TAVR procedures compared to men (54.1% vs 45.9%, P<0.0001 and were older than men who underwent TAVR. There was similar in-patient mortality in both group (1.7% vs 1.2%, AOR: 1.21, P=0.072, 95% CI 0.98- 1.51). Women had lower rate of cardiogenic shock (AOR: 0.78, P=0.009, 95% CI 0.65-0.94), pacemaker implantation (AOR: 0.84, P=0.001, 95% CI 0.76-0.93) compared to men. Women had higher odds of post-procedural complications compared to men (AOR: 1.18, P=0.001, 95% CI: 1.07-1.29. There were similar rates of ischemic stroke (AOR: 1.23, P=0.502, 95% CI 0.66-2.31), postprocedural kidney injury (AOR: 1.65, P=0.278, 95% CI 0.66-4.12) in women compared to men. In addition, there was no difference in total charge and length of hospital stay. Conclusions: Women had increased post-procedural complications compared to men in regard to TAVR, however, mortality is similar in both groups. There was no difference in resource utilization and length of stay between both sexes.

AB  - Aortic valve stenosis (AVS) is a sexually dimorphic cardiovascular disease that is driven by fibrosis and calcification of the aortic valve leaflets. Circulating inflammatory factors present in serum from AVS patients contribute to sex differences in valve fibro-calcification by driving the activation of valvular interstitial cells (VICs) to myofibroblasts and/or osteoblast-like cells. However, the molecular mechanisms by which inflammatory factors contribute to sex-specific valve fibro-calcification remain largely unknown. In this study, we identified inflammatory factors present in serum samples from AVS patients that regulate sex-specific myofibroblast activation and osteoblast-like differentiation. After correlating serum proteomic datasets with clinical and in vitro myofibroblast datasets, we identified annexin A2 and cystatin C as candidate inflammatory factors that correlate with both AVS patient severity and myofibroblast activation measurements in vitro. Validation experiments utilizing hydrogel biomaterials as cell culture platforms that mimic the valve extracellular matrix confirmed that annexin A2 and cystatin C promote sex-specific VIC activation to myofibroblasts via p38 MAPK signaling. Additionally, annexin A2 and cystatin C increase osteoblast-like differentiation primarily in male VICs. Our results implicate serum inflammatory factors as potential AVS biomarkers that also contribute to sexually dimorphic AVS progression by driving VIC myofibroblast activation and/or osteoblast-like differentiation. Collectively, the results herein further our overall understanding as to how biological sex may impact inflammation-driven AVS and may lead to the development of sex-specific drug treatment strategies.

AB  - The impact of sex on pathophysiological processes, clinical presentation, treatment options, as well as outcomes of degenerative aortic stenosis remain poorly understood. Female patients are well represented in transfemoral aortic valve implantation (TAVI) trials and appear to derive favorable outcomes with TAVI. However, higher incidences of major bleeding, vascular complications, and stroke have been reported in women following TAVI. The anatomical characteristics and pathophysiological features of aortic stenosis in women might guide a tailored planning of the percutaneous approach. We highlight whether a sex-based TAVI management strategy might impact on clinical outcomes. This review aimed to evaluate the impact of sex from diagnosis to treatment of degenerative aortic stenosis, discussing the latest evidence on epidemiology, patho-physiology, clinical presentation, therapeutic options, and outcomes. Furthermore, we focused on technical sex-oriented considerations in TAVI including the preprocedural screening, device selection, implantation strategy, and postprocedural management.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The objective of this study is to provide a comprehensive comparison of outcomes following acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD) repair in males and females. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: PubMed, Medline, and Web of Science were systematically searched by two authors for studies published from January 1st, 2000, to May 10th, 2021. Overall, 2405 articles were screened, and 16 were included in this review. Meta-analysis of the compiled data was performed. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Pooled estimates indicated no difference in operative (odds ratio (OR) 1.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.59-1.67, P=0.99, I2=52%), in-hospital (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.56-1.08; P=0.13, I2=57%), and 30-day mortality (OR 1.09, 95% CI 0.83-1.43, P=0.52, I2=45%) between the sexes. However, males had significantly reduced 5-year mortality rates (OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.51-1.00, P=0.05, I2=45%). There was no difference between sexes in rates of postoperative stroke (OR 1.07, 95% CI 0.86-1.33, P=0.54, I2=0%), atrial fibrillation (OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.82-1.19, P=0.92, I2=0%), as well as mesenteric or limb ischemia (OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.22-2.43, P=0.61, I2=77%; OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.30-2.30, P=0.72, I2=76%, respectively). Males did experience significantly increased rates of acute renal failure and reoperation (OR 1.35, 95% CI 1.16-1.56, P=0.0001, I2=29%; OR 1.40, 95% CI 1.09-1.81, P=0.010, I2=42%). CONCLUSIONS: Composite analysis indicates that early mortality does not differ between the sexes; however, late outcomes favor males. Differences in preoperative presentation and subsequent procedure selection between the sexes likely contribute to the disparity in late outcomes. Decision-making for surgical treatment of ATAAD should account for sex-specific risk factors.

AB  - Background: Current guidelines recommends to treat tricuspid regurgitation/annulus dilation (TR/D) at the time of aortic valve replacement (AVR) for aortic stenosis (AS). However, sex-differences in TR/D and right ventricle (RV) remodeling in AS in patients with AS have not been investigated. We thus aimed to evaluated the sex-differences in TR/D, RV remodeling, as well as their importance on survival after AVR. Methods and Results: We retrospectively analyzed the data of 198 patients with at least mild AS at baseline. AS and TR severity and RV dimensions were assessed by transthoracic echocardiography. Among these patients, 163 underwent an AVR within 3 months and were follow up during 5 +/- 1 years. Mean age was 76+/-12 years, 44% were women. Women presented with more TR than men (p=0.02; Figure). RV dimensions were significantly smaller in women than men (tricuspid annulus diameter: 34.0+/-0.7 vs 36.1+/- 0.5; mid-ventricular diameter: 29.7+/- 0.6 vs 33.1+/-0.6; height: 65.2+/-1.0 vs 73.4+/-0.9, all p≤0.01). However, after indexation to body surface area, tricuspid annulus diameter was larger in women than in men (20.4+/-0.4 vs 18.8+/-0.3, p= 0.002) while other dimensions were similar (Figure). TR≥3 was associated with increased mortality after AVR (HR:1.65 (1.15-2.37); p=0.007), while tricuspid annulus dilation was not (p=0.97). After adjustment by EuroSCORE 2, TR≥3 remained associated with mortality (HR:1.25 [1.08-6.69]; p=0.03; Figure), while dilated tricuspid annulus was not (p=0.52). Conclusion: Using indexed dimensions is essential to assess RV remodeling in patients with AS. Women appear to have more TR and tricuspid annulus dilation versus men. In turn, moderate / severe TR was associated with reduced survival. These findings may contribute to explain previous reports of worse outcomes in women versus men following surgical AVR.

AB  - Women with severe aortic stenosis (AS) have better long-term prognosis after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) compared to men. Whether this is caused by sex-related differences in left ventricular (LV) reverse remodeling after TAVI is unknown. Patients with severe AS who underwent transfemoral TAVI between 2007 and 2018 were selected. LV dimensions, volumes, and ejection fraction (LVEF) were assessed by transthoracic echocardiography before TAVI and at 6 and 12 months follow-up after TAVI. LV reverse remodeling was defined as the percentual LV mass index (LVMi) reduction compared to baseline. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. A total of 459 patients (80 ± 8 years; 52% male) were included. At 6 and 12 months follow-up, both sexes showed significant reductions in LV volumes and LVMi accompanied by improvement in LVEF, without significant differences between the sexes over time. During a median follow-up of 2.8 [IQR 1.9–4.3] years, 181 (39%) patients died. Women showed better outcomes compared to men (log-rank p = 0.024). In addition, male sex was independently associated with all-cause mortality in multivariable Cox regression (HR 1.423, 95% CI 1.039–1.951, p = 0.028). No association was observed between the interaction of percentual LVMi reduction and sex with outcomes (p = 0.64). Men and women with severe AS had similar improvement in LVEF, and similar reductions in LV volumes and LVMi at 6 and 12 months after TAVI. Women showed better survival after TAVI as compared to men. The superior outcomes noted in women after TAVI are not associated with sex differences in LV reverse remodeling. Graphical abstract: [Figure not available: see fulltext.]

AB  - Background: Outcomes after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and infectious diseases may vary according to sex. Methods: This multicentre study aimed to determine the sex differences in clinical characteristics, management, and outcomes of infective endocarditis (IE) after TAVR. A total of 579 patients (217 women, 37.5%) who had the diagnosis of definite IE following TAVR were included retrospectively from the Infectious Endocarditis After TAVR International Registry. Results: Women were older (80 ± 8 vs 78 ± 8 years; P = 0.001) and exhibited a lower comorbidity burden. Clinical characteristics and microbiological profiles were similar between men and women, but culture-negative IE was more frequent in women (9.9% vs 4.3%; P = 0.009). A high proportion of patients had a clinical indication for surgery (54.4% in both groups; P = 0.99), but a surgical intervention was performed in a minority of patients (women 15.2%, men 20.3%; P = 0.13). The mortality rate at index IE hospitalisation was similar in both groups (women 35.4%, men 31.7%; P = 0.37), but women exhibited a higher mortality rate at 2-year follow-up (63% vs 52.1%; P = 0.021). Female sex remained an independent risk factor for cumulative mortality in the multivariable analysis (adjusted HR 1.28, 95% CI 1.02-1.62; P = 0.035). After adjustment for in-hospital events, surgery was not associated with better outcomes in women. Conclusions: There were no significant sex-related differences in the clinical characteristics and management of IE after TAVR. However, female sex was associated with increased 2-year mortality risk.

AB  - Introduction: Sex based differences exist in the presentation, outcomes, and management of cardiovascular diseases. Although aortic valve calcium (AVC) score has been postulated to be associated with postprocedural outcomes after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), data on the impact of AVC score on procedural outcomes after TAVR based on sex have been scarce. Objective: The aim of the present study was to elucidate sex related differences in the prognostic impact of AVC score as a predictor of postprocedural outcomes and mortality in patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) who underwent TAVR. Methods: We retrospectively abstracted the records of 497 patients with severe AS who underwent TAVR between January 2016 and July 2019 at our institution. All patients underwent a non-contrast cardiac CT scan on a Siemens Somatom Definition Flash 128 slice scanner. AVC score using the Agatston method was calculated retrospectively. Primary outcome was 1-year mortality. Patients were divided into two groups: 1) Non-severe AVC score group [women <1200 Agatston unit (AU) and men <2000 AU]; 2) Severe AVC Score group [women >1200 AU and men >2000 AU]. Coxregression model was used to predict effect of variables on 1-year mortality in male and female patients. Results: Among 466 patients included, 268 patients were male and 198 were female (57.5% vs 42.5%). When compared with males, female patients had significantly lower AVC score (p<0.001), aortic valve area (AVA) (p<0.001), obstructive CAD (p<0.001), and history of previous PCI (p<0.004), and CABG (<0.001) but had a significantly higher STS score (6.7±3.2 vs 5.8±3.3 P=0.01). There was no difference between need for permanent pacemaker (PPM) implantation (11% vs 9.6%, p=0.4), major complications (16% vs 15%, p=0.9), stroke (0.8% vs 1.6%, p=0.7), 30-day (3.7% vs 4%, p=0.9), and 1-year mortality (14% vs 12%, p=0.6) between males and females, respectively. Female patients required smaller bioprosthetic valves compared with males (26±3.2 vs 30±3, p<0.001). Cox regression analysis for female patients showed BMI, hemoglobin level, and AVA independently predicted 1-year mortality, while there was no impact of severe AVC score (>1200 AU) on 1-year mortality in females. Similarly, Cox regression analysis for male patients showed there was no impact of severe AVC score (>2000 AU) on 1-year mortality in males. When males in the severe AVC group were compared with female patients in the severe AVC group, there was no difference in 30 day (4.3% vs 3.3%, p=0.82) and 1-year mortality (14.2% vs 13.3%, p=0.77). Similarly, in the severe AVC group there was no difference between need for PPM implantation (12.8% vs 12.1%, p=0.9), major complications (19.7% vs 15.8%, p=0.4), and stroke (2.2% vs 1%, p=0.6) between males and females, respectively. Conclusion: There were no sex differences in the impact of AVC score on mortality and post-procedural outcomes after TAVR.

AB  - Background: It has been suggested that the complexity of coronary artery disease (CAD) is a determinant of worse outcomes after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). However, no data is available showing this applies equally to both sexes. Purpose: Males are usually overrepresented in studies regarding CAD and care should be used when translating these results to the female population. The purpose of this analysis was to compare sex specific clinical outcomes in patients undergoing TAVI with and without coexisting CAD. Methods: All patients undergoing TAVI at a tertiary referral centre between 2008 and 2020 were included and outcomes up to five years after TAVI were prospectively recorded. Baseline and residual (after revascularization) SYNTAX-scores (SS) were retrospectively calculated to make groups of different CAD complexity. Results: A total of 605 patients, of whome 284 (46.9%) female patients, underwent TAVI. Five years after TAVI, females and males had similar overall survival (62 vs 59%, p=0.320) and cardiovascular mortality (22% vs 20%, p=0.540), respectively. Females were older (82.7y vs 80.8y, p<0.001), had a higher left ventricular ejection fraction (53.7% vs 49.4%, p<0.001) and higher aortic valve mean gradient (45.7 vs 41.6 mmHg, p=0.002). EuroScore II was comparable between both groups (26.8 vs 27.5, p=0.330). Females had less obstructive CAD (49% vs 64%, p<0.001) and less complex CAD (mean SS: 8.3 vs 12.6, p<0.001), despite reporting similar rates of angina (10% vs 11%, p=0.492). While in males CAD complexity was not predictive of survival (fig 1A) or cardiovascular mortality (fig 2A), females showed worse survival (fig 1B) and cardiovascular mortality (fig 2B) with increasing CAD complexity. This difference seems not to be driven by a lower rate of revascularization since women with CAD received significantly more percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) (41% vs 24%, p=0.001) and trended towards more complete revascularization (residual SS <8 70% in females vs 52% in males, p=0.054). Background medical therapy with aspirin (70% vs 72%, p=0.710), other antiplatelet agents (61% vs 57%, p=0.390) and statins (71% vs 81%, p=0.065) was not different between both groups. A possible explanation for the similar rates of angina despite less complex CAD in females might be a higher prevalence of underlying microvascular dysfunction, which is also known to be related with an increased rate of cardiovascular events. Conclusion:We show that in females outcomes after TAVI are significantly influenced by co-existing CAD and its complexity, while in males this is less pronounced. We identified a subgroup of females with a SS >22 that are at particular high risk for fatal cardiovascular events after TAVI. Therefore, awareness for CAD and close follow-up in combination with guidelinedirected treatment of complex CAD in females undergoing TAVI is crucial.

AB  - Objectives We aimed to describe the characteristics and to compare the sex differences in the clinical features and prognosis of Chinese elderly patients with senile degenerative valvular heart disease (VHD). Design This study was a nationwide, multicentre, prospective cohort study. Setting Participants were enrolled consecutively from 69 hospitals nationwide in China from September to December 2016. Participants A total of 2728 patients aged ≥60 years old with an aetiological diagnosis of moderate to severe degenerative VHD as defined by echocardiography were recruited. Main outcome measures The baseline data and 1-year follow-up data were collected, and disease distribution, clinical features, treatment and prognosis were compared between different sex groups. Results Aortic disease was more common in men, and mitral disease was more common in women. Male patients were more likely to have smoking, coronary heart disease, cardiomyopathy, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and coronary artery bypass grafting histories, while female patients had more hypertension and atrial fibrillation. The average age and left ventricular ejection fraction were significantly lower in men than in women (p<0.001), while the intervention rate (p=0.026) and total hospitalisation cost (p=0.016) of male patients were higher than those of female patients. There were no significant differences in perioperative complications, in-hospital outcomes or short and intermediate prognoses between the two groups. Conclusions Currently, the intervention rate of elderly patients with VHD is still not ideal, with dominant factor - patient rejection. Heart failure was the critical reason for rehospitalisation. There were some differences between men and women in the distribution, severity, clinical characteristics and interventions in senile degenerative valvular disease.

AB  - Background: The gender difference of the bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is not well understood. Objectives: We evaluated the impact of gender on the Sievers types, valvulopathy, aortopathy, and outcomes of aortic valve replacement (AVR) of BAV patients in a cohort of Chinese patients. Methods: Among 992 BAV patients without aortic dissection nor congenital heart disease, 658 underwent AVR. The demography, Sievers types, valvulopathy, aortopathy, and outcomes of AVR were compared between genders. Results: Aortic regurgitation (AR ≥ 2+) (39.0% vs. 12.8%, p <.001), aortic root dilation only (3.8% vs.8%, p =.014), and diffuse dilation (25.3% vs. 4.3%, p <.001) were more common in men, while moderate to severe aortic stenosis (AS) (21.3% vs. 45.7%, p <.001) and ascending dilation only (46.2% vs. 61.2%, p <.001) were more common in women. Men were more prone to develop preoperative AR ≥ 2+ (OR = 5.15, p <.001), moderate to severe AS + AR ≥ 2 + (OR = 2.95, p =.001), and Diffuse aortic dilation (OR = 3.91, p <.001). Sievers types did not have a significant effect on valvular dysfunction. Gender didn't predict early adverse events after AVR (n = 90) (HR = 1.21, p =.44), but male gender predicted a left ventricular ejection fraction <50% after AVR (OR = 3.07, p =.03). Conclusions: In this BAV series of Chinese patients, gender didn't differ significantly in Sievers types of BAV but showed significant differences in valvulopathy, aortopathy, and LV function after AVR. In addition, the male patients developed more severe conditions at a younger age.

AB  - Aortic stenosis (AS) is a fibrocalcific disease of the aortic valves (AVs). Sex-differences in AS pathophysiology have recently been described. High levels of fatty acid-binding protein 4 (FAPB4) in atherosclerotic plaques have been associated with increased local inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and plaque vulnerability. FABP4 pharmacological blockade has been shown to be effective for the treatment of atherosclerosis by modulating metabolic and inflammatory pathways. We aimed to analyze the sex-specific expression of FABP4 in AS and its potential role as a therapeutic target. A total of 226 patients (61.5% men) with severe AS undergoing surgical AV replacement were recruited. The FABP4 levels were increased in the AVs of AS patients compared to the control subjects, showing greater expression in the fibrocalcific regions. Male AVs exhibited higher levels of FABP4 compared to females, correlating with markers of inflammation (IL-6, Rantes), apoptosis (Bax, caspase-3, Bcl-2), and calcification (IL-8, BMP-2 and BMP-4). VICs derived from AS patients showed the basal expression of FABP4 in vitro. Osteogenic media induced upregulation of intracellular and secreted FABP4 levels in male VICs after 7 days, along with increased levels of inflammatory, pro-apoptotic, and osteogenic markers. Treatment with BMS309403, a specific inhibitor of FABP4, prevented from all of these changes. Thus, we propose FABP4 as a new sex-specific pharmacological therapeutic target in AS.

AB  - The lesions observed in AS have been shown to be sex specific, with women presenting extensive fibrotic remodeling while men developing more calcification deposit. We thus aimed to evaluate the influence of sex and sex hormones on the pathophysiology of aortic valve stenosis (AS) in our mouse model of AS. LDLr−/−ApoB100/100IGF-II+/− mice (n = 210) were separated in six different groups: (1) intact male (IM), (2) intact female (IF), (3) castrated male (CM), (4) ovariectomized females (OF), (5) CM with testosterone supplementation (CMT), and (6) OF with 17β-estradiol supplementation (OFE). Mice were fed a high-fat/high-sucrose/high-cholesterol diet for 6 months. Hemodynamic progression of AS was followed by transthoracic echocardiography (at 12 and 36 weeks) and analyzed in all mice alive at 36 weeks. Aortic valves were collected for histological and digital droplet PCR* analysis. Increases in peak velocity were comparable in IF and IM (24.2 ± 5.7 vs. 25.8 ± 5.3 cm/s; p = 0.68), but IF presented with less severe AS. Between the three groups of male mice, AS progression was more important in IM (increase in peak velocity: 24.2 ± 5.7 cm/s; p < 0.001) compared to CM (6.2 ± 1.4; p = 0.42), and CMT (15.1 ± 3.5; p = 0.002). In the three groups of female mice, there were no statistical differences in AS progression. Digital PCR analysis revealed an important upregulation of the osteogenic gene RunX2 in IM (p < 0.0001) and downregulation of the pro-calcifying gene ALPL in IF (p < 0.05). Male sex and testosterone play an important role in upregulation of pro-calcifying genes and hemodynamic progression of AS. However, female mice appeared to be protected against calcification, characterized by downregulation of pro-osteogenic genes, but presented a similar AS hemodynamic progression.

AB  - Aortic stenosis (AS) is the second most common valvular heart disease in the United States. Although the prevalence of AS does not significantly differ between the sexes, there is some controversy on whether sex differences affect the long-term mortality of patients with severe AS undergoing surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR). Therefore, we retrospectively analyzed the medical records of 917 patients (female, n = 424 [46.2%]) with severe AS who had undergone isolated SAVR at a tertiary care center between January 2005 and December 2018. During a median follow-up of 5.2 years, 74 (15.0%) male patients and 41 (9.7%) female patients died. The Kaplan–Meier analysis revealed that the 10-year mortality rate was significantly higher in male than female patients (24.7% vs. 17.9%, log-rank p = 0.005). In the sequential Cox proportional hazard regression model for assessing long-term mortality up to 10 years post-surgery, the adjusted hazard ratio of male sex for mortality was 1.93 (95% confidence interval, 1.28–2.91; p = 0.002). The association between male sex and postoperative long-term mortality was not significantly diminished by any demographic or clinical factor in subgroup analyses. In conclusion, female sex was significantly associated with better long-term survival in patients with severe AS undergoing SAVR.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Presentation, management and outcomes in the aortic dissection (AD) of ascending thoracic aortic aneurysm (ATAA) differ in gender and age. The purpose of this study is to investigate the dissection properties of male and female ATAAs. METHODS: Peeling tests were performed to quantitatively determine the delamination strength and dissection energy of 41 fresh ATAA samples (22 males and 19 females) in relatively young (≤65 years) and elderly (>65 years) patients. The delamination strength of the ATAAs was further correlated with patient ages for males and females. The histological investigation was employed to characterize the dissected morphology. RESULTS: For elderly patients, circumferential and longitudinal delamination strengths of the female ATAAs were statistically significantly lower than those of the males (circumferential: 31 ± 6 vs 42 ± 6 mN/mm, P < 0.01; longitudinal: 35 ± 7 vs 49 ± 10 mN/mm, P = 0.02). No significant differences were found in the delamination strength between males and females for relatively young patients. The circumferential and longitudinal delamination strengths were significantly decreased and strongly correlated with patient ages for females. However, these correlations were not present in males. Dissection routes propagated in the aortic media to create ruptured surfaces for all specimens. Peeling tests of the male ATAAs generate rougher surfaces than females. CONCLUSIONS: There is a higher propensity of AD occurrence for the elderly females as compared to males with matched ages. Surgeons should be cognizant of the risk of AD onset later in life, especially in females.

AB  - Background: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is now an approved alternative to surgical aortic valve replacement for the treatment of severe aortic stenosis. As the clinical adoption of TAVR expands, it remains important to identify predictors of mortality after TAVR. We aimed to evaluate the impact of sex differences in aortic valve calcium score (AVCS) on long-term mortality following TAVR in a large patient sample. Methods: We included consecutive patients who successfully underwent TAVR for treatment of severe native aortic valve stenosis from June 2010 to May 2021 across all US Mayo Clinic sites with follow-up through July 2021. AVCS values were obtained from preoperative computed tomography of the chest. Additional clinical data were abstracted from medical records. Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox-proportional hazard regression models were employed to evaluate the effect of AVCS on long-term mortality. Results: A total of 2543 patients were evaluated in the final analysis. Forty-one percent were women, median age was 82 years (Q1: 76, Q3: 86), 18.4% received a permanent pacemaker following TAVR, and 88.5% received a balloon expandable valve. We demonstrate an increase in mortality risk with higher AVCS after multivariable adjustment (P<0.001). When stratified by sex, every 500-unit increase in AVCS was associated with a 7% increase in mortality risk among women (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.07 [95% CI, 1.02-1.12]) but not in men. Conclusions: We demonstrate a notable sex difference in the association between AVCS and long-term mortality in a large TAVR patient sample. This study highlights the potential value of AVCS in preprocedural risk stratification, specifically among women undergoing TAVR. Additional studies are needed to validate this finding.

AB  - Cardiovascular disease (CVD) represents the most important cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide. There is heterogeneity in the epidemiology and management of CVD between male and female patients. In the specific case of acute aortic dissection (AAD), women, at the time of diagnosis, are older than men and complain less frequently of an abrupt onset of pain with delayed presentation to the emergency department. Furthermore, a history of hypertension and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is more common among women. In type A AAD, women more often experience pleural effusion and coronary artery compromise, but experience less neurological and malperfusion symptoms. They undergo less frequent surgical treatment and have higher overall in-hospital mortality. Conversely, in type B AAD no significant differences were shown for in-hospital mortality between the two genders. However, it should be highlighted that further studies are needed in order to develop AAD gender specific preventive, diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.

AB  - Background: Recent data showed poor long-term survival in patients with moderate AS. Although sex differences in left ventricular (LV) remodeling and outcome are well described in severe AS, it has not been evaluated in moderate AS. Methods: In this retrospective, multicenter study, patients with a first diagnosis of moderate AS diagnosed between 2001 and 2019 were identified. Clinical and echocardiographic parameters were recorded at baseline and compared between men and women. Patients were followed up for the primary endpoint of all-cause mortality with censoring at the time of aortic valve replacement. Results: A total of 1895 patients with moderate AS (age 73 ± 10 years, 52% male) were included. Women showed more concentric hypertrophy and had more pronounced LV diastolic dysfunction than men. During a median follow-up of 34 (13-60) months, 682 (36%) deaths occurred. Men showed significantly higher mortality rates at 3- and 5-year follow-up (30% and 48%, respectively) than women (26% and 39%, respectively) (p = 0.011). On multivariable analysis, male sex remained independently associated with mortality (hazard ratio 1.209; 95% CI: 1.024-1.428; p = 0.025). LV remodeling (according to LV mass index) was associated with worse outcomes (hazard ratio 1.003; CI: 1.001-1.005; p = 0.006), but no association was observed between the interaction of LV mass index and sex with outcomes. Conclusions: LV remodeling patterns are different between men and women having moderate AS. Male sex is associated with worse outcomes in patients with medically treated moderate AS. Further studies investigating the management of moderate AS in a sex-specific manner are needed.

AB  - Objective: Inequalities in postoperative outcomes between males and females are well described with females often experiencing inferior outcomes after heart valve surgery. The recent literature has demonstrated equivalent or improved outcomes for females after transcatheter aortic valve replacement. Transcatheter mitral valve repair (TMVr) and replacement (TMVR) is a relatively newer field with significantly less literature comparing sex differences. This systematic review and meta-analysis looks to provide a comprehensive summary of the published literature comparing outcomes between males and females undergoing transcatheter MV interventions. Methods: PubMed, MEDLINE, and Scopus were systematically searched for all studies comparing outcomes between males and females undergoing TMVr and TMVR. A total of 2,178 English manuscript titles and abstracts were reviewed. Articles were excluded if data were not provided regarding sex differences, transcatheter MV intervention, full-length text was not accessible, or if insufficient data was provided. A total of 2,170 articles were excluded, and 8 articles were included in this study. Results: Pooled estimates of outcomes demonstrated rates of acute kidney injury (OR 1.28 [95% CI, 1.14-1.44; p < 0.0001]) favored females, while rates of major bleeding favored males (OR 0.85 [95% CI 0.76-0.96; p = 0.01]). Rates of mortality, postoperative MI, and stroke did not differ significantly. Conclusion: A trend has emerged in heart valve interventions with males tending to have improved outcomes after surgical intervention and females experiencing equivalent or improved outcomes after transcatheter interventions. This meta-analysis identified increased rates of acute kidney injury for males, increased rates of major bleeding for females, and otherwise comparable morbidity and mortality in males and females undergoing TMVr.

AB  - Atrial functional regurgitation is caused by atrioventricular annulus dilation, with normal leaflets and ventricular dimensions and function within the normal range. Its occurrence, in both mitral and tricuspid valves, implies a worse prognosis due to the hemodynamic derangement they produce, but also constitutes a marker of greater comorbidity and more advanced disease. Predisposing conditions for these heart valve dysfunctions are mainly atrial fibrillation and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. However, other factors like female sex also may be involved and influence their incidence, especially for atrial tricuspid regurgitation. In the present review, we analyze sex differences in the reported prevalence of atrial mitral and tricuspid regurgitation, and suggest possible mechanisms involved. Finally, we underline potential therapeutic and preventive strategies to reduce the burden of these heart valve disorders and discuss research gaps.

AB  - Objectives: Morphometric analysis is necessary for planning endovascular procedures of the ascending aorta and aortic arch. Several studies have demonstrated gender differences with respect to arterial size. Moreover, the aortic diameter varies significantly between the systolic and diastolic phases of the cardiac cycle. The primary end point of this study was to verify the presence of morphometric variability between genders. The secondary end point was to determine gender-specific predictors for ascending aortic and arch size. Methods: Electrocardiogram-gated cardiac computed tomography scans from 116 patients who were evaluated for transcatheter aortic valve replacement were retrospectively reviewed. Measurements of the ascending aorta and aortic arch were made in multiplanar views perpendicular to the semiautomatically computed centerline. Propensity modeling techniques were used to investigate whether gender influences aortic morphology. Comparisons were performed among the propensity score-matched women and men. Multiple linear regression analysis for predictors affecting the ascending aortic and aortic arch size in men and women were performed. Results: Propensity score matching identified 40 pairs (caliper 0.2 standard deviation). The systolic and diastolic mean diameters at the sinotubular junction, mid-ascending aorta, proximal to the innominate artery ostium, proximal to the left common carotid artery and the left subclavian artery, and the ascending aortic length were significantly larger in the men, both before and after propensity score matching analysis. On average, the male aortas were 7.4% larger than the female aortas, in both systole and diastole (Fig 1). Multiple regression analysis identified age, body surface area, diabetes, and smoking as predictive factors for aortic size in men and the presence of diabetes and body surface area as predictive factors in women (Fig 2). Conclusions: Our analysis demonstrated that men have larger ascending aortas and arches than women. The body surface area, smoking, age, and diabetes were associated with aortic size. These variables should be considered by aortic endovascular manufactures and physicians when developing ascending and arch endografts and planning such related interventions.

AB  - Aims: Women with severe aortic stenosis (AS) have better long-term outcome after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) but worse survival after surgical aortic valve replacement compared with men. Whether this is related to sex differences in left ventricular (LV) remodelling is unknown. The aim of this study was to examine the sex differences in LV remodelling with multidetector row computed tomography (MDCT) and outcome in patients with severe AS undergoing TAVI between 2007 and 2018. Methods and results: A total of 289 patients (age 80 ± 6 years, 54% male) were included. LV volumes, mass, and function were analysed on pre-procedural MDCT scans. Women showed smaller LV volumes and mass compared with men. Patients were classified into four LV remodelling patterns: concentric hypertrophy (50%) was the most frequent pattern of LV remodelling followed by eccentric hypertrophy (33%), normal geometry (13%), and concentric remodelling (4%). Men showed more concentric remodelling compared with women (91% vs. 9%, respectively, P = 0.011). However, no differences were observed in the remaining LV remodelling patterns. During a median follow-up of 3.8 (IQR 2.2-5.1) years after TAVI, 87 (30%) patients died. Women demonstrated better outcome after TAVI compared with men (log-rank χ2 = 4.29, P = 0.038). No association was observed between the interaction of the LV remodelling patterns and sex with outcome. Conclusion: LV concentric hypertrophy and eccentric hypertrophy are similarly observed in men and women with severe AS but concentric remodelling was more common in men. Women demonstrated better outcome after TAVI when compared with men. The interaction between the LV remodelling patterns and sex was not associated with survival.

AB  - Background: Calcific aortic valve stenosis (CAVS) is the most common heart valve disease that affects 3% of the population. CAVS is a progressive, multifactorial disorder driven by several cellular and molecular pathological processes. Currently, there is no pharmacological therapy able to prevent CAVS progression. Little is known about the sex-related difference in molecular mechanisms. Recent studies reported that men showed a higher aortic valve calcium load than women, which in turn, developed more fibrosis in the stenotic aortic valve leaflets. Hence, it has been hypothesized that the mechanisms underlying CAVS progression could be different between the two sexes. Purpose: To investigate sex-differences in CAVS molecular pathways, finding new sex-related pharmacological targets. Methods: Valve interstitial cells (VIC) were isolated from 26 patients who underwent aortic valve replacement for aortic valve stenosis. RNA, extracted from VICs, was sequenced by third generation sequencing technology. We performed pro-fibrotic (TGFβ) treatment for 5 days and we evaluated soluble collagen expression by a colorimetric assay and αSMA expression by western blot. We evaluated extracellular calcium extent by a colorimetric assay on VICs exposed to pro-calcific (inorganic phosphate) medium for 7 days. We assessed the mitochondrial damage with mitoSOX staining by Imagestream. Results: The gene expression analysis from sequenced VICs revealed 65 genes upregulated in men and 89 genes upregulated in women. The functional analysis showed that the TGFβ signaling resulted enriched in woman VICs, while the mitochondrial related genes were upregulated in man VICs. Only woman VICs secreted higher amount of collagen under TGFβ treatment respect to the untreated (1.22±0.03 fold change (FC) vs. untreated, p<0.001). αSMA expression (marker of VICs activation) was significantly higher both in men and women exposed to different concentrations of TGFβ (TGFβ 5ng/ml: 1.88±0.34 in men and 2.66±0.32 in women, FC vs. untreated, p=0.003 and p<0.0001, respectively; TGFβ 10ng/ml: 2.96±0.55 in men and 2.16±0.35 in women, FC vs. untreated, p=0.0003 and p=0.0006, respectively). The calcification potential of VICs exposed to pro-calcific medium was higher in men than in women (8.23±0.45 vs. 4.69±0.59 FC vs. untreated, respectively, p<0.0001). The mitochondrial superoxide formation in man VICs was higher than in woman VICs at steady state (51.0±2.1% vs. 29.5±0.9% of positive cells, respectively, p<0.0001) Conclusion: CAVS progression seems to be driven by sex-dependent molecular pathways activation. In particular, pro-fibrotic pathways are upregulated in women, while pro-calcific pathways and mitochondrial damage in men. Our data pave the way to sex-dependent pharmacological target research, aiming to treat CAVS patients.

AB  - Numerous sex-based differences are observed across the spectrum of valvular heart disease, starting with pathophysiology and progression of disease, moving on to compensation and comorbidities (both cardiovascular such as coronary artery disease and noncardiovascular such as frailty), assessment of severity and hemodynamics including timing of intervention, and procedural risks/benefits and outcomes. The aortic valve is perhaps best understood with sex differences in both pathologic changes and response to volume and pressure overload, yet large gaps in our understanding still exist. Studies of other valve diseases have focused on differences in prevalence, presentation, and outcomes for surgical or transcatheter therapies. Defining sex-specific responses to valvular heart disease may improve disease recognition, define treatment strategies, and improve outcomes.

AB  - Background: We investigated the relationship of sex with clinical outcomes after proximal aortic (ascending and arch) operations, and whether sex-specific preoperative factors are associated with mortality. Methods: Of 3745 patients who underwent elective, urgent, and emergency proximal aortic operations over a 30-year period, 1153 pairs of men and women were propensity-matched, and their early and long-term outcomes were compared. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to estimate late survival. Results: Women and men had similar operative mortality (9.1% vs 8.8%, P = .8), stroke (5.7% vs 5.6%, P = .9), and renal failure rates (7.0% vs 6.6%, P = .7). Thirty-day mortality was 7.5% vs 5.6% (P = .06), respectively. Results were less favorable for women than for men regarding respiratory failure (34.3% vs 29.2%, P=0.008) and intensive care unit length of stay (9.11 ± 11.9 vs 7.87 ± 12.48 days; P = .023). Long-term survival was not significantly different between women and men: 66.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] 62.8%-69.5%) vs 67.1% (95% CI 63.6%-70.4%) at 5 years, and 45.9% (95% CI 41.76%-50.0%) vs 46.2% (95% CI 41.7%-50.6%) at 10 years (P = .4). Preoperative factors including diabetes, prior stroke, prior renal insufficiency, and peripheral vascular disease were associated with operative mortality in men, whereas chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was the main risk factor in women. Conclusions: No differences were seen between the sexes in life-changing adverse outcomes after ascending aortic and arch procedures, although specific preoperative variables were associated with specific adverse events. Recognizing differences in preoperative risk factors for mortality between the sexes may facilitate targeted preoperative assessment, preparation, and counseling.

AB  - Contemporary data on gender differences in outcomes after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI), after stratification by age, remain limited. We studied age-stratified (60 to 70, 71 to 80, and 81 to 90 years) inhospital outcomes by gender after TAVI from the National Inpatient Sample database between 2012 and 2018. We analyzed National Inpatient Sample data using the International Classification of Diseases, Clinical Modification, Ninth Revision, and Tenth Revision claims codes. Between the years 2012 and 2018, a total of 188,325 weighted hospitalizations for TAVI were included in the analysis. A total of 21,957 patients were included in the 60 to 70 age group (44% females), 60,770 (45% females) in the 71 to 80 age group, and 105,580 (50% females) in the 81 to 90 age groups, respectively. Propensity-matched inhospital mortality rates were significantly higher for females than males for the age group of 81 to 90 years (3.0% vs 2.1%, p <0.01). Vascular complications and a need for blood transfusions remained significantly higher for females on propensity-matched analysis across all categories of ages. Conversely, acute kidney injury and the need for pacemaker implantation remained significantly higher for males across all age groups. In conclusion, we report that mortality is higher in female patients who underwent TAVI between the ages of 81 to 90. Moreover, the female gender was associated with higher vascular complications and bleeding requiring transfusions. Conversely, the male gender was associated with higher rates of pacemaker implantation and acute kidney injury.

AB  - Background: Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) disease is the most common congenital heart disease and the main etiology of aortic stenosis (AS) in young adults. Patients with Bicuspid AS (BAS) were excluded from pivotal trials that established transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) for AS due to anatomic challenges. Recent studies have showed that TAVR in BAS have comparable outcomes to surgical AVR (SAVR). The US FDA recently approved TAVR for BAS, while international guidelines recommend SAVR. We aimed to investigate the trends and gender differences in utilization of TAVR in patients with BAS. Methods: Using the National Inpatient Sample from 2013 to 2019, we identified patients with BAS who underwent TAVR using ICD codes. The sample was divided into 2 cohorts based on gender. Outcomes included trends and gender differences of TAVR utilization rate in BAS. Results: The analysis included 175,270 hospitalizations with a diagnosis of BAS, of which 31.5% included female patients and 2.3% underwent TAVR (n = 4031). The rate of TAVR increased from 0.6% in 2013 (n = 125) to 4.8% in 2019 (n = 1,435; ptrend <.001). Although the overall rate of TAVR was statistically higher for women compared to men (2.9% vs. 2.0%, p <.001), a similar increase in the rate of TAVR was observed regardless of whether the patient was female or male (Figure 1; both ptrend <.001; trend difference p =.600). Conclusion: There is a steady increase in TAVR use for BAV stenosis, along with a significantly higher overall rate of TAVR utilization rate in women. [Formula presented]

T2  - Pediatric Cardiology
AB  - Marfan syndrome is caused by mutations of the fibrillin-1 gene, which weakens the connective tissue integrity. Since 2003, bioavailability regulations of TGF-ß through fibrillin alterations have been presumed of being the culprit mechanisms for aortic aneurysm development. We present the analysis of our single-center Marfan children and adolescents cohort to assess the influence of age, sex, degree of cardiovascular involvement and dosage on losartan effectivity. This prospective longitudinal registered echocardiographical investigation (EudraCT 2009-016139-36) of 49 patients with an average follow-up of 72 months focused on aortic root z-scores, elasticity, and yearly progression rates. The 33 patients under medication with losartan showed an aortic root z-score reduction during the first 36 months compared to 22 patients without medication presenting constant mild progression. Yet, results diminished under losartan thereafter, adding up to similar progressions over 72 months in both groups (0.07 ± 0.10/year versus 0.04 ± 0.11/year). Although male patients exhibited higher root z-scores, progression with and without medication was comparable to females and not age-dependent. In conclusion, losartan evoked a significant aortic root z-score regression in young Marfan patients over the first 3 years, but this effect mitigated thereafter. The initial improvement concurred with ameliorated elasticity; lower stiffness levels predicted better clinical outcome, but likewise only up to 36 months. Sex differences in dilatation severity were observed but neither age nor sex had significant influence on progression rates. Losartan dosages were gradually increased in more severely affected patients and provided an equal rate of root progression over 72 months in comparison to patients under losartan treatment with lesser baseline dilatation severity.

AB  - This Atlas chapter summarizes sex- and some gender-associated, and unique aspects and manifestations of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in women. CVD is the primary cause of premature death in women in Canada and numerous sex-specific differences related to symptoms and pathophysiology exist. A review of the literature was done to identify sex-specific differences in symptoms, pathophysiology, and unique manifestations of CVD in women. Although women with ischemic heart disease might present with chest pain, the description of symptoms, delay between symptom onset and seeking medical attention, and prodromal symptoms are often different in women, compared with men. Nonatherosclerotic causes of angina and myocardial infarction, such as spontaneous coronary artery dissection are predominantly identified in women. Obstructive and nonobstructive coronary artery disease, aortic aneurysmal disease, and peripheral artery disease have worse outcomes in women compared with men. Sex differences exist in valvular heart disease and cardiomyopathies. Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction is more often diagnosed in women, who experience better survival after a heart failure diagnosis. Stroke might occur across the lifespan in women, who are at higher risk of stroke-related disability and age-specific mortality. Sex- and gender-unique differences exist in symptoms and pathophysiology of CVD in women. These differences must be considered when evaluating CVD manifestations, because they affect management and prognosis of cardiovascular conditions in women.

AB  - Calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) is the most common heart valvular disease in the developed world. Most of the relevant research has been sex-blind, ignoring sex-related biological variables and thus under-appreciate sex differences. However, females present pronounced fibrosis for the same aortic stenosis (AS) severity compared with males, who exhibit more calcification. Herein, we present a computational model of fibrocalcific AV, aiming to investigate its effect on AS development. A parametric study was conducted to explore the influence of the total collagen fiber volume and its architecture on the aortic valve area (AVA). Towards that goal, computational models were generated for three females with stenotic AVs and different volumes of calcium. We have tested the influence of fibrosis on various parameters as fiber architecture, fibrosis location, and transvalvular pressure. We found that increased fiber volume with a low calcium volume could actively contribute to AS and reduce the AVA similarly to high calcium volume. Thus, the computed AVAs for our fibrocalcific models were 0.94 and 0.84 cm2 and the clinical (Echo) AVAs were 0.82 and 0.8 cm2. For the heavily calcified model, the computed AVA was 0.8 cm2 and the clinical AVA was 0.73 cm2. The proposed models demonstrated how collagen thickening influence the fibrocalcific-AS process in female patients. These models can assist in the clinical decision-making process and treatment development in valve therapy for female patients.

AB  - Aims: To assess gender differences in in-hospital mortality and 90-day readmission rates among patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) in the USA. Methods and results: Hospitalizations for TAVR were retrospectively identified in the National readmissions database (NRD) from 2012 to 2017. Gender based differences in in-hospital mortality and 90-day readmissions were explored using multivariable logistic regression models. During the study period, an estimated 171 361 hospitalizations for TAVR were identified, including 79 722 (46.5%) procedures in women and 91 639 (53.5%) in men. Unadjusted in-hospital mortality and 90-day all-cause readmissions were significantly higher for women compared with men (2.7% vs. 2.3%, P = 0.002; 25.1% vs. 24.1%, P = 0.012, respectively). After adjusting for baseline characteristics, women had 13% greater adjusted odds of in-hospital mortality [adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 1.13, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.02-1.26, P = 0.017], and 9% greater adjusted odds of 90-day readmission compared with men (aOR: 1.09, 95% CI: 1.05-1.14, P < 0.001). During the study period, there was a steady decrease in-hospital mortality (5.3% in 2012 to 1.6% in 2017; Ptrend < 0.001) and 90-day (29.9% in 2012 to 21.7% in 2017; Ptrend < 0.001) readmission rate in both genders. Conclusion: In-hospital mortality and readmission rates for TAVR hospitalizations have decreased over time across both genders. Despite these improvements, women undergoing TAVR continue to have a modestly higher in-hospital mortality, and 90-day readmission rates compared with men. Given the expanding indications and use of TAVR, further research is necessary to identify the reasons for this persistent gap and design appropriate interventions.

AB  - Objective: We aim to analyse sex-specific differences in aortic valves (AVs) and valve interstitial cells (VICs) from aortic stenosis (AS) patients. Approach and Results: 238 patients with severe AS undergoing surgical valve replacement were recruited. Two hundred and two AVs (39.1% women) were used for ex vivo analyses and 36 AVs (33.3% women) for in vitro experiments. AVs from men presented increased levels of the inflammatory molecules interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, Rantes, and CD45. Oxidative stress (eNOS, myeloperoxidase, malondialdehyde and nitrotyrosine) was upregulated in male AVs. Concerning fibrosis, similar levels of collagen type I, decreased levels of collagen type III and enhanced fibronectin, active Lox-1 and syndecan-1 expressions were found in AVs from men compared with women. Extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling was characterized by reduced metalloproteinase-1 and 9 expression and increased tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 expression in male AVs. Importantly, osteogenic markers (bone morphogenetic protein-9, Rank-L, osteopontin, periostin, osteocalcin and Sox-9) and apoptosis (Bax, Caspase 3, p53, and PARP1) were enhanced in AVs from men as compared to women. Isolated male VICs presented higher myofibroblast-like phenotype than female VICs. Male VICs exhibited increased inflammatory, oxidative stress, fibrotic, apoptosis and osteogenic differentiation markers. Conclusions: Our results suggest that the mechanisms driving the pathogenesis of AS could be different in men and women. Male AVs and isolated VICs presented more inflammation, oxidative stress, ECM remodeling and calcification as compared to those from women. A better knowledge of the pathophysiological pathways in AVs and VICs will allow the development of sex-specific options for the treatment of AS.

AB  - Heart failure affects over 2.6 million women and 3.4 million men in the United States with known sex differences in epidemiology, management, response to treatment, and outcomes across a wide spectrum of cardiomyopathies that include peripartum cardiomyopathy, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, stress cardiomyopathy, cardiac amyloidosis, and sarcoidosis. Some of these sex-specific considerations are driven by the cellular effects of sex hormones on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, endothelial response to injury, vascular aging, and left ventricular remodeling. Other sex differences are perpetuated by implicit bias leading to undertreatment and underrepresentation in clinical trials. The goal of this narrative review is to comprehensively examine the existing literature over the last decade regarding sex differences in various heart failure syndromes from pathophysiological insights to clinical practice.

AB  - As populations age worldwide, the burden of valvular heart disease has grown exponentially, and so has the proportion of affected women. Although rheumatic valve disease is declining in high-income countries, degenerative age-related causes are rising. Calcific aortic stenosis and degenerative mitral regurgitation affect a significant proportion of elderly women, particularly those with comorbidities. Women with valvular heart disease have been underrepresented in many of the landmark studies which form the basis for guideline recommendations. As a consequence, surgical referrals in women have often been delayed, with worse postoperative outcomes compared with men. As described in this review, a more recent effort to include women in research studies and clinical trials has increased our knowledge about sex-based differences in epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnostic criteria, treatment options, outcomes, and prognosis.

AB  - Objectives Outcomes of sex differences in major cardiac surgery remain controversial. A comprehensive understanding of sex differences in major adult cardiac surgery could provide better knowledge of risk factors, management strategy and short-term or long-term outcomes. The present study aimed to investigate sex differences in the risks of outcomes of major cardiac surgeries and subgroup analyses of different valve types. Design Population-based nationwide cohort study. Setting Data were obtained from National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) in Taiwan. Participants A total of 66 326 adult patients (age ≥20 years; 30.3% women) who underwent a first major cardiac surgery (isolated coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), isolated valve or concomitant bypass/valve) from 2000 to 2013 were identified via Taiwan NHIRD. Main outcome measures Outcomes of primary interest were in-hospital death and all-cause mortality during follow-up period. Propensity score matching was conducted as a secondary analysis for the sensitivity test. Results Women who underwent isolated CABG tended to have greater risks of both in-hospital (OR 1.37; 95% CI 1.26 to 1.49) and late outcomes (HR 1.26; 95% CI 1.22 to 1.31). Women after concomitant CABG/valve also had a greater in-hospital (OR 1.19; 95% CI 1.01 to 1.40) and long-term mortality (HR 1.14; 95% CI 1.05 to 1.24). Women after isolated mitral valve repair have a non-favourable outcome of in-hospital mortality (OR 1.70; 95% CI 1.01 to 2.87). Women who did not receive an isolated aortic valve replacement had more favourable all-cause mortality outcome (HR 0.90; 95% CI 0.84 to 0.96). Secondary analysis in the propensity score-matching cohort demonstrated results similar to the primary analysis. Conclusions Female patients who underwent procedures involving CABG (with or without concurrent valvular intervention) had generally worse outcomes. However, the results of isolated valve surgery were variable on the basis of the type of intervened valve.

AB  - Background: Worse outcomes have been reported for women with type A acute aortic dissection (TAAD). We sought to determine sex-specific operative approaches and outcomes for TAAD in the current era. Methods: The Interventional Cohort (IVC) of the International Registry of Acute Aortic Dissection (IRAD) database was queried to explore sex differences in presentation, operative approach, and outcomes. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to identify adjusted outcomes in relation to sex. Results: Women constituted approximately one-third (34.3%) of the 2823 patients and were significantly older than men (65.4 vs 58.6 years, P <.001). Women were more likely to present with intramural hematoma, periaortic hematoma, or complete or partial false lumen thrombosis (all P <.05) and more commonly had hypotension or coma (P =.001). Men underwent a greater proportion of Bentall, complete arch, and elephant trunk procedures (all P <.01). In-hospital mortality during the study period was higher in women (16.7% vs 13.8%, P =.039). After adjustment, female sex trended towards higher in-hospital mortality overall (odds ratio, 1.40; P =.053) but not in the last decade of enrollment (odds ratio, 0.93; P =.807). Five-year mortality and reintervention rates were not significantly different between the sexes. Conclusions: In-hospital mortality remains higher among women with TAAD but demonstrates improvement in the last decade. Significant differences in presentation were noted in women, including older age, distinct imaging findings, and greater evidence of malperfusion. Although no distinctions in 5-year mortality or reintervention were observed, a tailored surgical approach should be considered to reduce sex disparities in early mortality rates for TAAD.

T2  - European Heart Journal Cardiovascular Imaging
AB  - Background: Previous studies have reported major sex differences in prevalence, demographics, and timing of intervention in left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction. Whether the observed differences are related to LVOT anatomy is less explored. Purpose: The aim of this study was to assess the anatomic substrate for LVOT obstruction by echocardiography to identify sex-specific phenotypes. Methods: We included 76 patients (37% women) with symptomatic LVOT obstruction referred to a tertiary care centre between 2005-2020 to be considered for septal ablation or myectomy. A standardized echocardiography was extended with systematic measurements of parasternal LVOT dimensions at 5, 10 and 15 mm below the aortic valve, proximal septal thickness at 10, 20 and 30 mm, subaortic septal bulge radius and aortoseptal angle in all patients prior to intervention (Image). Measurements were also adjusted for body surface area (BSA). A total of 3 patients had to be excluded from analysis due to poor image quality. Results: Women were older (p < 0.001, Table), while there were no differences in body mass index (27.6 v.s. 27.5, p = ns), systolic and diastolic blood pressure (133 v.s 133 mmHg, p = ns and 75 v.s 80 mmHg, p = ns, respectively), or prevalence of hypertension (24% v.s. 29%, p = n.s). Left ventricular end-diastolic diameter, LVOT diameters and septum thickness measured 30 mm from the aortic valve were lower in women (Table). However, in all these measurements the differences disappeared after adjusting for BSA. There were no sex differences in posterior wall thickness. Furthermore, the aortoseptal angle was steeper among women, and the septum bulge radius smaller, remaining so even after adjustment for BSA(Table). Conclusion: In women with LVOT obstruction, the septum bulge radius adjusted for BSA was smaller, and the aortoseptal angle steeper. Our findings suggest that there may be important sex differences in the echocardiographic phenotype in LVOT obstruction.

AB  - Background: Guidelines recommend measurement of the aortic valve calcification (AVC) score to help differentiate between severe and nonsevere aortic stenosis, but a paucity exists in data about AVC in the general population. The aim of this study was to describe the natural history of AVC progression in the general population and to identify potential sex differences in factors associated with this progression rate. Methods: Noncontrast cardiac computed tomography was performed in 1298 randomly selected women and men aged 65 to 74 years who participated in the DANCAVAS trial (Danish Cardiovascular Screening). Participants were invited to attend a reexamination after 4 years. The AVC score was measured at the computed tomography, and AVC progression (ΔAVC) was defined as the difference between AVC scores at baseline and follow-up. Multivariable regression analyses were performed to identify factors associated with ΔAVC. Results: Among the 1298 invited citizens, 823 accepted to participate in the follow-up examination. The mean age at follow-up was 73 years. Men had significantly higher AVC scores at baseline (median AVC score 13 Agatston Units [AU; interquartile range, 0-94 AU] versus 1 AU [interquartile range, 0-22 AU], P<0.001) and a higher ΔAVC (median 26 AU [interquartile range, 0-101 AU] versus 4 AU [interquartile range, 0-37 AU], P<0.001) than women. In the fully adjusted model, the most important factor associated with ΔAVC was the baseline AVC score. However, hypertension was associated with ΔAVC in women (incidence rate ratios, 1.58 [95% CI, 1.06-2.34], P=0.024) but not in men, whereas dyslipidemia was associated with ΔAVC in men (incidence rate ratio: 1.66 [95% CI, 1.18-2.34], P=0.004) but not in women. Conclusions: The magnitude of the AVC score was the most important marker of AVC progression. However, sex differences were significant; hence, dyslipidemia was associated with AVC progression only among men; hypertension with AVC progression only among women.

T2  - European Cardiology Review
AB  - Aortic stenosis (AS) is the most common valvular heart disease and the main indication for valvular replacement in older women. Correct AS grading is mandatory for an adequate selection of patients for both surgical and transcatheter aortic valve replacement. Women and men have different AS severity grades at the same level of aortic valve calcification. Moreover, besides having smaller cardiac volumes, left ventricular outflow tract and aortic size, women have a specific pattern of left ventricular structural and functional remodelling in response to the AS-related chronic pressure overload. Here, the sex-specific cardiac changes in AS that make AS grading more challenging in women, with consequences for the management and outcome of this group of patients, are reviewed.

AB  - Background: Contemporary data on sex differences in outcomes after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), after stratification by age, remain limited. Methods: We studied age-stratified (60-70, 71-80, and 81-90 years) outcomes by sex after TAVR from the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) database between 2012 and 2018. We analyzed NIS data using International Classification of Diseases, Clinical Modification-Ninth Revision-Clinical Modification and International Classification of Diseases-Tenth Revision-Clinical Modification claims codes. Results: Between 2012 and 2018, 188,325 weighted hospitalizations for TAVR were included in the analysis. A total of 21,957 patients were included in the age 60 to 70 group (44% women), 60,770 in the age 71 to 80 group (45% women), and 105,580 in the age 81 to 90 group (50% women). Propensity-matched in-hospital mortality rates were significantly elevated for women compared with men for the age 81 to 90 group (3.0% vs 2.1%; P < 0.01). Vascular complications and need for blood transfusions remained significantly higher for women on propensity-matched analysis across all categories of ages Conversely, acute kidney injury and the need for pacemaker implantation remained significantly higher for male sex across all age groups. [Formula presented] Conclusion: We report that mortality is higher in female patients undergoing TAVR between 81 and 90 years of age. Moreover, female sex is associated with higher vascular complications and bleeding requiring transfusions. Conversely male sex is associated with higher rates of pacemaker implantation and acute kidney injury. Further study, including even more contemporary data, is needed to understand and reduce sex-based disparities in TAVR. Categories: STRUCTURAL: Valvular Disease: Aortic

AB  - Background: Trends in transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) procedures, clinical outcomes, and resource utilization are limited. This study aimed to evaluate the year-to-year trend in outcomes, length of stay, and total hospital charges in a US population among patients with TAVR. Methods: The National Inpatient Sample was queried for all patients who underwent a TAVR procedure in the United States between 2012 and 2018. We adjusted for inflation using the Medical Expenditure Panel Price Index. Years, age, and sex differences in the population accounted for using conditional marginal effects. Outcomes assessed included inpatient mortality, length of stay, and hospital cost. Outcomes were adjusted for age, sex, race, hospital characteristics (teaching status), and the Elixhauser Comorbidity Index. Hospitalization outcomes were modeled using logistic and Poisson regression for binary outcomes and continuous outcomes, respectively. Results: Among patients undergoing a TAVR procedure between 2012 and 2018, the mean age was 79.98 years (SD: ±8.5); 53.6% were males; and 86.6% were White, 4.31% Black, 4.86% Asian, and 4.2% other race (4.2%). The TAVR mortality rate decreased from 1.61% in 2012 to 0.51% in 2018 (P trend < 0.0001) (Figure 1). The median length of hospital stay decreased from 5.4 days in 2012 to 2.7 days in 2018 (P trend = 0.0001). The median total hospital cost decreased from $55,436 in 2012 to $43,771 in 2018 (P trend = 0.0001). Conclusion: The number of TAVR procedures continues to steadily increase over each year, likely reflecting the steady growth in TAVR centers across the United States. Importantly, inpatient mortality, length of stay, and hospital cost are on the decline. Possible reasons include better patient selection, improvements in both technology and procedural technique, and medical management.

AB  - Background: Patients treated for aortic stenosis have a higher prevalence of atrial fibrillation (AF) and a greater risk for adverse clinical outcomes. We aimed to evaluate the year-to-year trends in outcomes, length of stay (LOS), and total hospital cost (THC) among patients with transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and underlying AF. Methods: The National Inpatient Sample was queried for all patients with secondary diagnoses of AF who underwent TAVR in the United States from 2012 to 2018. We adjusted for inflation using the Medical Expenditure Panel price index. Years, age, and sex differences in the population were accounted for using conditional marginal effects. Outcomes assessed included inpatient mortality, LOS, and THC. Outcomes were adjusted for age, sex, race, hospital characteristics (teaching status), and Elixhauser Comorbidity Index. Hospitalization outcomes were modeled using logistic and Poisson regression for binary and continuous outcomes, respectively. Results: A total of 49,415 TAVR procedures in patients with known AF were included; the mean age was 81.2 ± 7.5 years, 55.7% were men, 89.6% were White, 2.9% were Black, and 3.8% were Asian. TAVR inpatient mortality rates decreased from 1.2% in 2012 to 0.39% in 2018 (P for trend < 0.0001) (Figure 1). The median LOS decreased from 5.8 days in 2012 to 3 days in 2018 (P for trend = 0.0001). Median THC decreased from $55,918 in 2012 to $43,494 in 2018 (P for trend = 0.0001). Conclusion: AF is a common comorbid condition in patients undergoing TAVR and is associated with worse outcomes. Although TAVR procedures among patients with underlying AF are increasing, inpatient mortality rates, LOS, and THC are declining. Possible reasons include better patient selection, improvements in both technology and procedural technique, and medical management. Categories: ENDOVASCULAR: Aortic Disease and Aortic Intervention

AB  - Background: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has emerged as a definitive option for severe aortic stenosis. Although a growing body of research has highlighted the impact of sex on outcomes after TAVR, the direction and magnitude of this relationship remain unclear. In this study we investigated the impact of sex on clinical outcomes after TAVR in a nationally representative cohort. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed hospital admission data for patients undergoing TAVR between 2016 and 2018 in the National Inpatient Sample, an all-payer inpatient database maintained by the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project that estimates more than 37 million annual hospitalizations. Main study outcomes included in-hospital mortality, procedural complications, length of stay, and cost of care. Multilevel modelling was used to adjust for patient and hospital characteristics. Results: A total of 148,264 patients underwent TAVR from 2016 to 2018, of whom 68,435 (46.2%) were women. Female patients were similar in age (80.1 vs 79.2 years; P < 0.0001), primarily insured by Medicare (91.8%), and less likely Caucasian (85.5% vs 88.0%; P < 0.0001) than their male counterparts. There was no significant difference in comorbidities, periprocedural rates of stroke, gastrointestinal bleeding, venous thromboembolism, or use of mechanical ventilation between female and male patients. After multivariable adjustment, female patients had higher mortality (1.78 vs 1.32%; adjusted odds ratio: 1.41; P < 0.001). There were no clinically significant differences in length of stay (4.3 vs 4.5 days; incidence rate ratio: 1.03; P < 0.001) or cost of care ($50,386 vs $50,472; B = 0.004; P = NS). Conclusion: In-hospital mortality is 41% higher among female patients undergoing TAVR despite a similar comorbidity profile and rate of periprocedural complications. Although several studies have shown a long-term survival benefit for women, further research is needed to elucidate the etiology of sex-related differences in periprocedural mortality.

AB  - Nearly all cardiovascular diseases show sexual dimorphisms in prevalence, presentation, and outcomes. Until recently, most clinical trials were carried out in males, and many animal studies either failed to identify the sex of the animals or combined data obtained from males and females. Cellular sex in the heart is relatively understudied and many studies fail to report the sex of the cells used for in vitro experiments. Moreover, in the small number of studies in which sex is reported, most of those studies use male cells. The observation that cells from males and females are inherently different is becoming increasingly clear – either due to acquired differences from hormones and other factors or due to intrinsic differences in genotype (XX or XY). Because of the likely contribution of cellular sex differences in cardiac health and disease, here, we explore differences in mammalian male and female cells in the heart, including the less-studied non-myocyte cell populations. We discuss how the heart's microenvironment impacts male and female cellular phenotypes and vice versa, including how secretory profiles are dependent on cellular sex, and how hormones contribute to sexually dimorphic phenotypes and cellular functions. Intracellular mechanisms that contribute to sex differences, including gene expression and epigenetic remodeling, are also described. Recent single-cell sequencing studies have revealed unexpected sex differences in the composition of cell types in the heart which we discuss. Finally, future recommendations for considering cellular sex differences in the design of bioengineered in vitro disease models of the heart are provided.

AB  - Introduction Sex-dependent differences of infective endocarditis (IE) have been reported. Women suffer from IE less frequently than men and tend to present more severe manifestations. Our objective was to analyse the sex-based differences of IE in the clinical presentation, treatment, and prognosis. Material and methods We analysed the sex differences in the clinical presentation, modality of treatment and prognosis of IE in a national-level multicentric cohort between 2008 and 2018. All data were prospectively recorded by the GAMES cohort (Spanish Collaboration on Endocarditis). Results A total of 3451 patients were included, of whom 1105 were women (32.0%). Women were older than men (mean age, 68.4 vs 64.5). The most frequently affected valves were the aortic valve in men (50.6%) and mitral valve in women (48.7%). Staphylococcus aureus aetiology was more frequent in women (30.1% vs 23.1%; p<0.001). Surgery was performed in 38.3% of women and 50% of men. After propensity score (PS) matching for age and estimated surgical risk (European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation II (EuroSCORE II)), the analysis of the matched cohorts revealed that women were less likely to undergo surgery (OR 0.74; 95% CI 0.59 to 0.91; p=0.05). The observed overall in-hospital mortality was 32.8% in women and 25.7% in men (OR for the mortality of female sex 1.41; 95% CI 1.21 to 1.65; p<0.001). This statistical difference was not modified after adjusting for all possible confounders. Conclusions Female sex was an independent factor related to mortality after adjusting for confounders. In addition, women were less frequently referred for surgical treatment.

AB  - Introduction: Women with severe aortic valve stenosis (AS) have better long-term prognosis after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) compared to men. Whether this is caused by sex-related differences in left ventricular (LV) reverse remodeling after TAVI is unknown. Purpose: To examine the interaction between sex and LV reverse remodeling with outcome after TAVI. Methods: Patients with severe AS who had undergone transfemoral TAVI between 2007 and 2018 were selected. LV dimensions, volumes and ejection fraction (LVEF) were assessed by transthoracic echocardiography at baseline before TAVI, and at 6 and 12 months after TAVI. LV reverse remodeling was defined as %LV mass index (LVMi) reduction from baseline. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. Results: A total of 459 patients (80±8 years; 52% male) were included. Before TAVI, indexed LV end-diastolic and end-systolic volume as well as LVMi were smaller in women versus men. At 6 and 12 months follow-up, both sexes showed significant reductions in LV volumes and LVMi accompanied by improvement in LVEF, without significant differences between the sexes over time (p for interaction=0.51, p=0.43, p=0.44 and p=0.30, respectively). During a median follow-up of 2.8 [IQR 1.9-4.3] years, 181 (39%) patients died. Women showed better outcome compared to men (log-rank p=0.024). In addition, male sex was independently associated with all-cause mortality in multivariable Cox regression (HR 1.423, 95% CI: 1.039-1.951, p=0.028). No association was observed between the interaction of %LVMi reduction and sex with outcome (p=0.64). Conclusions: Patients with severe AS had significant improvement in LVEF, reduction in LV volumes and LVMi at 6 and 12 months after TAVI, without significant differences between sexes over time. Women showed better survival after TAVI as compared to men despite being treated at older age. The interaction between %LVMi reduction and sex was not associated with survival.

AB  - Introduction: Female sex is considered an independent risk factor for mortality and morbidity following cardiac surgery. This study is the first to review the UK national database to compare outcomes following surgical revascularisation and valvular cardiac procedures between females and males. Hypothesis: Females have worse outcomes following cardiac surgery than males. Methods: Using data from National Adult Cardiac Surgery Audit (NACSA), we identified all elective and urgent, isolated coronary artery by-pass grafting (CABG), aortic valve replacement (AVR) and mitral valve replacement/repair (MVR) procedures from 2010-2018. We compared baseline data, operative data and outcomes of mortality, stroke, renal failure, deep sternal wound infection, return to theatre for bleeding and length of hospital stay. Multivariable logistical/linear regression models were used to assess relationships between sex and our outcomes, adjusting for baseline characteristics. Results: Females, compared to males, had a greater odds of experiencing 30-day mortality in each procedure (CABG OR 1.76, CI 1.47-2.09, p<0.001; AVR OR 1.59, CI 1.27-1.99, p<0.001; MVR OR 1.37, CI 1.09-1.71, p=0.006). After CABG, females also experienced increased need for postoperative dialysis (OR 1.31, CI 1.12-1.52, p<0.001), deep sternal wound infections (OR 1.43, CI 1.11-1.83, p=0.005) and length of stay (Beta 1.2, CI 1.0-1.4, p<0.001) compared to males. Female sex was protective against returning to theatre for post-operative bleeding following CABG (OR 0.76, CI 0.65-0.87, p<0.001) and AVR (OR 0.72, CI 0.61-0.84, p<0.001). Conclusions: Despite advances in cardiac surgery, females in the UK have an increased risk of short-term mortality after cardiac surgery compared to males. This highlights the need to focus on the understanding of the causes behind these disparities and therefore implementation of strategies to improve this.

AB  - Objective Determine whether associations between bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) phenotypes, valve disease and aortopathy differ between sexes. Methods 1045 patients with BAV (76.0% men, n=794) from two surgical centres were included in this cross-sectional study. Valve phenotype was classified intraoperatively as right-left (RL), right-non-coronary (RN), left-non-coronary (LN) or 2-sinus BAV. Echocardiography was used to determine type and degree of valve disease, and aortic dimensions. Aortic dilatation was defined as diameter ≥4.5 cm. Results RL was the most common phenotype (73.6%), followed by RN (16.2%), 2-sinus BAV (9.2%) and LN (1.1%), with no difference in phenotype distribution between men and women (p=0.634). Aortic valve insufficiency (AI) prevalence differed significantly with valve phenotype in men (p=0.047), with RL and LN having the highest prevalence (34.1% and 44.0%, respectively). In women, RN had a higher proportion of AI than RL (21.3% vs 7.3%, p=0.017). Men with RL had larger root dimensions, in particular at the sinus (mean difference 0.24 cm compared with RN, p=0.002). Men with 2-sinus BAV had the highest prevalence of root phenotype dilatation (7.0%, other phenotypes ≤2.3%, p=0.031), whereas women with 2-sinus BAV did not have root dilatation and smaller sinus dimensions (mean difference: 0.35 cm compared with RL, p=0.021). Aortic root segments were larger in men with AI compared with aortic stenosis (sinus mean difference: 0.40 cm, p<0.001). The difference was even larger in women (mean difference: 0.78 cm, p<0.001), and women with AI also had larger tubular segments (mean difference: 0.61 cm, p=0.001). Conclusions There are significant sex differences in clinical associations of BAV phenotypes, which should be considered in further studies on the role of phenotypes in individualised patient management.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The data on the differential impact of sex on the utilization and outcomes of valve replacement surgery for infective endocarditis are limited to single-center and small sample size patient population. METHODS AND RESULTS: We utilized the National Inpatient Sample database to identify patients with a discharge diagnosis of infective endocarditis from 2004 to 2015 to assess differences in the characteristics and clinical outcomes of patients hospitalized with infective endocarditis stratified by sex. We also evaluated trends in utilization of cardiac valve replacement and individual valve replacement surgeries in women versus men over a 12-year period, and compared in-hospital mortality after surgical treatment in women versus men. A total of 81 942 patients were hospitalized with a primary diagnosis of infective en-docarditis from January 2004 to September 2015, of whom 44.31% were women. Women were less likely to undergo overall cardiac valve replacement (6.92% versus 12.12%), aortic valve replacement (3.32% versus 8.46%), mitral valve replacement (4.60% versus 5.57%), and combined aortic and mitral valve replacement (0.85% versus 1.81%) but had similar in-hospital mortality rates. From 2004 to 2015, the overall rates of cardiac valve replacement increased from 11.76% to 13.96% in men and 6.34% to 9.26% in women and in-hospital mortality declined in both men and women. Among the patients undergoing valve replacement surgery, in-hospital mortality was higher in women (9.94% versus 6.99%, P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Despite increased utilization of valve surgery for infective endocarditis in both men and women and improving trends in mortality, we showed that there exists a treatment bias with underutilization of valve surgeries for infective endocar-ditis in women and demonstrated that in-hospital mortality was higher in women undergoing valve surgery in comparison to men.

AB  - Cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality for women in United States and worldwide. One in 3 women dies from cardiovascular disease, and 45% of women >20 years old have some form of CVD. Historically, women have had higher morbidity and mortality after cardiac surgery. Sex influences pathogenesis, pathophysiology, presentation, postoperative complications, surgical outcomes, and survival. This review summarizes current cardiovascular surgery outcomes as they pertain to women. Specifically, this article seeks to address whether sex disparities in research, surgical referral, and outcomes still exist and to provide strategies to close these gaps. In addition, with the growing population of women of reproductive age with cardiovascular disease and cardiovascular risk factors, indications for cardiac surgery arise in pregnant women. The current review will also address the unique issues associated with this special population.

AB  - TOPIC: Cardiovascular Disease TYPE: Original Investigations PURPOSE: While sex-related disparities in intermediate term outcomes have been reported following transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), disparate predictors of mortality in men and women undergoing TAVR have not been well studied. METHODS: This prospective institutional registry included 285 consecutive patients (147 men, 138 women) who underwent TAVR from December 2015- June 2018 at an academic tertiary medical center. Baseline and clinical characteristics, procedural data, and clinical outcomes at 1-year were recorded. RESULTS: All-cause mortality rates at 1 year were 10.9% and 19.7% in women and men respectively (p = 0.039). In multivariable regression analysis, female sex was independently associated with lower 1-year mortality following TAVR (odds ratio (OR) 0.40, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.17-0.95). Sex-specific risk-adjusted predictors of mortality post TAVR included atrial fibrillation (OR 7.20, 95%CI 1.84-28.21) and pre-procedural hemoglobin (per g/dl) (OR 0.56, 95%CI 0.35-0.89) in women and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR 3.66, 95% CI 1.31-10.18), creatinine clearance (OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.96-1.00), and weight (per kg) (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.91-0.99) in men. CONCLUSIONS: In this prospective institutional registry of adults undergoing TAVR, risk-adjusted 1-year mortality is significantly lower in women, and disparate predictors of risk-adjusted mortality exist in men and women. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Disparate predictors of 1-year mortality exist in men and women undergoing TAVR. Further studies of sex-related differences in post procedural care following TAVR are warranted.

AB  - Background: Women with severe aortic valve stenosis (AS) have better long-term outcomes after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) but worse survival after surgical aortic valve replacement compared to men. Whether this is related to sex differences in left ventricular (LV) remodeling is unknown. Purpose: To examine sex differences in LV remodeling and outcomes in patients with severe AS undergoing TAVI. Methods: Patients with severe AS who underwent TAVI between 2007 and 2018 with a pre-procedural multidetector row computed tomography (MDCT) scan were included. LV volumes, mass and function were analyzed with MDCT. Patients were classified into 4 LV remodeling patterns based on LV mass index and LV mass-to-volume ratio: 1) normal geometry, 2) concentric remodeling, 3) concentric hypertrophy and 4) eccentric hypertrophy. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality after TAVI. Results: A total of 289 patients (age 80±6 years, 54% male) were included. Women showed smaller LV volumes and mass compared to men. Concentric hypertrophy (50%) was the most frequent pattern of LV remodeling followed by eccentric hypertrophy (33%), normal geometry (13%) and concentric remodeling (4%). Concentric remodeling was more frequently observed in men compared to women (91% vs. 9% respectively, p=0.011). However, no sex differences were observed in the remaining LV remodeling patterns (Figure 1). During a median follow-up of 3.8 (IQR 2.2-5.1) years after TAVI, 87 patients died. Women demonstrated better outcome after TAVI compared to men (log-rank χ2=4.29, p=0.038). The survival benefit of women over men was mainly present among patients with concentric hypertrophy (log-rank χ2=4.91, p=0.027, Figure 2). Conclusion: LV concentric and eccentric hypertrophy are similarly observed in men and women with severe AS. Women demonstrated better outcome after TAVI as compared to men, particularly among those with LV concentric hypertrophy. However, the outcome benefit of females after TAVI seems not to be related to sex-differences in LV remodeling. (Figure Presented).

AB  - Introduction: Congenital Heart Disease (CHD) affects under 1% of newborns and thanks to its prognosis improvement, most patients survive until adulthood. Dextro-transposition of the great arteries (dTGA) is a CHD classically palliated with atrial switch (ATS) procedure and nowadays corrected with an arterial switch (ARS), with better clinical outcomes. Nevertheless, several post-ATS patients remain alive and questions persist regarding their long-term prognosis. Purpose: To observe a group of dTGA patients followed in an Adult CHD outpatients clinic, access their comorbidities, surgical interventions, complications and clinical outcomes. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed a group of dTGA patients born between 1974 and 2001. Clinical features were collected and time-to-event statistics were analyzed. Adverse event was defined as at least one of the follows: death, stroke, myocardial infarction or coronary revascularization, arrhythmia and ventricular, valvular or conduct dysfunction. Results: A total of 80 patients were enrolled with a mean follow-up of 26 years after surgery: 46% were female, median age 27 (19-57) year-old. Concerning other concomitant defects, 25% had ventricular septal defect, 12% pulmonary stenosis, 3%aortic coarctation and 1% single coronary ostium. ATS palliation was performed in 54% of patients (Senning procedure in 95%) and ARS (Jatene procedure) in 45% of patients; median age at procedure was 13 months and 10 days, respectively. During follow-up, almost all patients submitted to ARS remained in sinus rhythm (97%) versus 64% of ATS patients (p=0.037). The latter group had higher incidence of arrythmias (40% vs 3%, p=0.013), mostly atrial flutter or fibrillation (present in 28%), followed by bradyarrhythmia (10%); median time from surgery to first arrhythmic event in these patients was 23 years. Also, systemic ventricle systolic dysfunction (SVSD) and chronotropic incompetence were significantly higher in ATS (41% vs 3%, p<0.001 and 46% vs 9%, p=0.005, respectively); mean time to SVSD was 29 years. In respect to long-term outcomes in ARS, the most frequent complications were moderate to severe aortic regurgitation, pulmonary stenosis and regurgitation, occurring in 21%, 7% and 3%, respectively. Concerning both groups, mean time to first adverse-event was 21 years. Regarding gender and demographic features, there were no differences in time-to-adverse-event, comparing patients living in urban versus rural neighbourhoods and female versus male (Log Rank, p=0.368 and p=0.693). Only one patient died, submitted to ATS, at 46 years-old, from chronic heart failure. Conclusion: After a long-term free of events, ATS patients experienced more arrhythmic complications and SVSD. ARS complications were anastomosis related. This report highlights the efforts that should be made to identify late complication is this particular population. Of note, no demographic or gender differences were observed.

AB  - Introduction: Women comprise ≥50% patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Women have different baseline clinical characteristics and some studies have suggested that TAVR procedure carries better results and prognosis. Purpose: Evaluate gender differences in baseline characteristics and longterm outcomes in patients with aortic stenosis undergoing TAVR. Methods: A cohort study was conducted. Consecutive patients underwent TAVR from January 2012 to December 2020 were included. Clinical and follow-up characteristics were recorded. MACE (major adverse cardiovascular events including all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident and heart failure hospitalization) as primary outcome was searched. Results: A total of 292 consecutive patients were included. 48.95% were women and median age was 81.07 years (77.73-86.22). 77% TAVR patients received self-expanding prosthesis. Compared with men, women were significantly older and had lower glomerular filtration rate but a lower prevalence of comorbid conditions, such as atrial fibrillation (AF), coronary and peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and cerebrovascular disease. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was higher in women. Global baseline characteristics and events at follow-up are summarized in figure 1. At a median follow up of 21.30 (8.52-38.94) months, MACE were lower in women (Odds ratio [OR] 0.60 95% CI: 0.36-1.00). Additionally, women showed lower rates of heart failure hospitalizations (OR 0.34 95% CI 0.16- 0.70). There were no statistically significant differences in all-cause mortality. Survival curves for the endpoint of heart failure hospitalizations are represented in figure 2, showing a significant difference between men and women, and demonstrating that the latter present fewer events during follow-up (HR 0.42 95% CI 0.21-0.83). Conclusion: In our study, female TAVR recipients had better outcomes than men. The possible reasons for this female-sex-related benefit could be due to better LVEF and fewer comorbidities. Understanding the reasons why men have worse prognostic post-TAVR is essential for guarantee appropriate treatment selection, as well as for achieving the best possible long-term and safety outcomes.

AB  - Background: Sex-differences in left ventricular (LV) remodeling in patients with aortic valve disease have been reported. However, sex-differences in LV remodeling and mechanics in response to aortic valve replacement (AVR) remained largely unexplored. Purpose: The present study aimed to evaluate the sex-differences during the time course of LV remodeling and LV mechanics (by LV global longitudinal strain (GLS)) after aortic valve replacement. Methods: Patients with severe aortic valve disease (aortic stenosis (AS) or aortic regurgitation (AR)) undergoing AVR with echocardiographic followup at 1,2, and/or 5 years were evaluated. LV mass index, LV ejection fraction, LV GLS and stroke volume (SV) were measured. Linear mixed models analyses were used to assess changes in LV mass index, LVEF, LV GLS and SV between time points. The models were corrected for age, LV enddiastolic diameter at baseline and time between echocardiograms. Results: A total of 211 patients (61±14 years, 61% male) with severe aortic valve disease (AS 63% or AR 39%) were included. Before AVR, men had larger LV mass index and higher SV compared to women. Both men and women had a preserved LV ejection fraction (54±12 and 56±9, P=0.102, respectively), but moderately impaired LV GLS (14.6±4.1 and 16.1±4.1, P=0.009, respectively). After AVR, both groups showed LV mass regression, improvement in LV ejection fraction and LV GLS. LV mass index and SV remained higher in men. During follow-up women showed significantly better LV GLS compared to men (P=0.030, figure 1). Conclusion: In men and women with severe aortic valve disease undergoing AVR, the time course of changes in LV mass regression, LV ejection fraction, LV GLS and SV are similar. During follow-up LV mass index remained larger in men and women showed significantly better LV GLS.

AB  - Introduction: Gender disparity in the management of a variety of cardiovascular disorders has been well established. Studies have shown that women are less likely to undergo surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR), and have higher mortality and health care cost in the management of aortic stenosis (AS). The impact of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) on this gender disparity has not been well established. Purpose: We sought to examine the impact of gender on outcomes following aortic valve replacement for AS in the era of routine transcatheter valve replacement. Methods: We used the National Inpatient Sample (2009-18), a representative probability sample of the United States, to study visits for all aortic valve replacements and in-hospital outcomes as a function of gender. Survey estimation commands were used to provide national estimates. Results: There were an estimated 431,344 SAVR and 189,137 TAVR inpatient visits during the periods of 2009-18 and 2011-18, respectively with a higher representation of women in the TAVR cohort (46.4% [95% CI, 45.9%-46.9%]) than SAVR (36.8% [95% CI, 36.4%-37.2%]). Women were slightly older with higher prevalence of uncomplicated hypertension (HTN) and pulmonary circulation disorders. However, women exhibited a lower prevalence of complicated HTN, complicated diabetes mellitus, prior percutaneous coronary intervention, prior coronary artery bypass grafting, peripheral vascular disease and renal failure. In-hospital mortality was higher in women after SAVR (3.8%±0.1 vs 2.7%±0.07, p<0.001) and TAVR (2.4%±0.1 vs 1.7%±0.1, p<0.001) compared to men. Female SAVR patients had higher rates of permanent pacemaker (PPM) implantation, stroke and significant bleeding (5.9%±0.1 vs 5%±0.1, 2.8%±0.1 vs 2.3%±0.07, and 37.8%±0.8 vs 29.8%±0.6; p<0.001, respectively) but lower rates of acute kidney injury (AKI) (16.4%±0.3 vs 20.3%±0.3, p<0.001). In addition, women undergoing TAVR had higher rates of stroke and significant bleeding (2.4%±0.1 vs 1.6%±0.09 and 28.7%±0.6 vs 22%±0.5; p<0.001 respectively) but lower rates of PPM and AKI (9.5%±0.3 vs 10.7%±0.2 and 11.3%±0.3 vs 13.4%±0.3; p<0.001, respectively). There was a reduction in mortality, compared to the early TAVR era, for all groups during the study period, particularly in female TAVR patients (from approximately 5.2% to 1.7%). In-hospital mortality for women was lower after TAVR than SAVR, both after multivariable adjustment (OR = 0.33, 95% CI 0.24- 0.45) and propensity matching (mean difference 1.28%±0.49). Conclusions: TAVR appears to have narrowed the gender disparity in the management of AS. Although women continue to have a higher in-hospital mortality following both TAVR and SAVR compared to men, TAVR is associated with a lower inpatient mortality in women compared to SAVR. Thus, TAVR may represent a bridge for the gender gap in aortic valve replacement.

AB  - Introduction/Objective: Sex disparity is reported across all forms of cardiovascular diseases. Only few studies have focused on sex differences in thoracic aortic disease pathology. We aim to identify and understand sex differences in this patient group to bridge the knowledge gap and improve clinicopathologic outcomes. Methods/Case Report: This is a retrospective analysis of 83 proximal thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection (TAAD) cases treated at a single quaternary care center in 2019. Chart review was done for demographics. Consensus criteria (Stone JR et al. Cardiovasc Pathol 2015; 24:267-78; Halushka MK et al. Cardiovasc Pathol 2016; 25:247-57) and a scoring system (Waters KM et al. Cardiovasc Pathol 2017; 30:6-11) were used for pathology reporting. Clinical correlation was also made. Pearson's chi-square test was used for statistical analysis. Results (if a Case Study enter NA): 83 patients (61 male and 22 female) were retrieved. Overall thoracic aortopathy was higher among males, accounting for 73.4% of individuals with TAAD. In a subgroup analysis, there was no sex difference in dissection, aortic root involvement, and bicuspid aortic valve (p>0.05). Genetic aortopathy was more prevalent in females than males (27.2% vs 9.8%, p=0.04) alongside early age at first aortic event (median age: 31y vs 52y). Histopathologically, females had frequent translamellar mucoid extracellular matrix accumulation (45.4% vs 22.9%, p=0.04), extensive (54.5% vs 27.8%, p=0.02) and severe (59% vs 34.4%, p=0.04) elastic fiber fragmentation, higher band like (9% vs 6.5%, p>0.05) plus extensive (13.6% vs 4.9%, p>0.05) smooth muscle nuclei loss, and extensive (13.6% vs 1.6%, p=0.01) plus dense (4.5% vs 1.6%, p>0.05) laminar medial collapse than males. Conclusion: In our patient population, females have a lower prevalence of thoracic aortic disease treated with open repair. However, those who develop TAAD harbor a greater burden of wall pathology and probable worse outcomes. We recommend sex-based analysis of all research on thoracic aortic diseases.

AB  - Gender-differences in survival following transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) have been suggested. The objective of this study was to analyze outcomes following TAVR according to gender and to compare outcomes between TAVR and SAVR in women, at a nationwide level. Based on the French administrative hospital-discharge database, the study collected information for all consecutive patients treated with TAVR and SAVR between 2010 and 2019. Outcomes were analyzed according to gender and propensity score matching was used for the analysis of outcomes. In total 71,794 patients were identified in the database. After matching on baseline characteristics, we analyzed 12,336 women and 12,336 men treated with TAVR. In a second matched analysis, we compared 9,297 women treated with TAVR and 9,297 women treated with SAVR. Long term follow-up showed lower risk of all-cause death (12.7% vs 14.8%, hazard ratio (HR) 0.85, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.90) in women than men. Although the difference in cardiovascular death remained non-significant (5.8% vs 6.0%, HR 0.96, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.05), non-cardiovascular death was less frequent in women than in men following TAVR (6.9% vs 8.8% HR 0.78, 95%CI 0.72 to 0.84).When TAVR was compared with SAVR in women, long-term follow-up with TAVR showed higher rates of all-cause death (11.2% vs 6.5%, HR 1.91, 95%CI 1.78 to 2.05), cardiovascular death (5.0% vs 3.2%, HR 1.44, 95%CI 1.30 to 1.59), and non-cardiovascular death (6.2% vs 3.3%, HR 2.48, 95% CI 2.25 to 2.72). In conclusion, we observed that women undergoing TAVR have lower long-term all-cause mortality as compared with TAVR in men, driven by non-cardiovascular mortality. SAVR was associated with lower rates of long-term cardiovascular adverse events in women as compared with TAVR.

AB  - Background: TAVR is a safe alternative to surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR); how-ever, sex-related differences are still debated. This research aimed to examine gender differences in a real-world transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) cohort. Methods: All-comer aor-tic stenosis (AS) patients undergoing TAVR with a Medtronic valve across 19 Italian sites were prospectively included in the Italian Clinical Service Project (NCT01007474) between 2007 and 2019. The primary endpoint was 1-year mortality. We also investigated 3-year mortality, and ischemic and hemorrhagic endpoints, and we performed a propensity score matching to assemble patients with similar baseline characteristics. Results: Out of 3821 patients, 2149 (56.2%) women were en-rolled. Compared with men, women were older (83 ± 6 vs. 81 ± 6 years, p < 0.001), more likely to present severe renal impairment (GFR ≤ 30 mL/min, 26.3% vs. 16.3%, p < 0.001) but had less previous cardiovascular events (all p < 0.001), with a higher mean Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) score (7.8% ± 7.1% vs. 7.2 ± 7.5, p < 0.001) and a greater mean aortic gradient (52.4 ± 15.3 vs. 47.3 ± 12.8 mmHg, p < 0.001). Transfemoral TAVR was performed more frequently in women (87.2% vs. 82.1%, p < 0.001), with a higher rate of major vascular complications and life-threatening bleeding (3.9% vs. 2.4%, p = 0.012 and 2.5% vs. 1.4%, p = 0.024). One-year mortality differed between female and male (11.5% vs. 15.0%, p = 0.002), and this difference persisted after adjustment for sig-nificant confounding variables (Adj.HR1yr 1.47, 95%IC 1.18–1.82, p < 0.001). Three-year mortality was also significantly lower in women compared with men (19.8% vs. 24.9%, p < 0.001) even after adjustment for age, STS score, eGFR, diabetes and severe COPD (Adj.HR3yr 1.42, 95%IC 1.21–1.68, p < 0.001). These results were confirmed in 689 pairs after propensity score matching. Conclusion: Despite higher rates of peri-procedural complications, women presented better survival than men. This better adaptive response to TAVR may be driven by sex-specific factors.

AB  - Aims: It is not known whether transaortic flow rate (FR) in aortic stenosis (AS) differs between men and women, and whether the commonly used cut-off of 200 mL/s is prognostic in females. We aimed to explore sex differences in the determinants of FR, and determine the best sex-specific cut-offs for prediction of all-cause mortality. Methods and results: Between 2010 and 2017, a total of 1564 symptomatic patients (mean age 76 ± 13 years, 51% men) with severe AS were prospectively included. Mean follow-up was 35 ± 22 months. The prevalence of cardiovascular disease was significantly higher in men than women (63% vs. 42%, P < 0.001). Men had higher left ventricular mass and lower left ventricular ejection fraction compared to women (both P < 0.001). Men were more likely to undergo an aortic valve intervention (AVI) (54% vs. 45%, P = 0.001), while the death rates were similar (42.0% in men and 40.6% in women, P = 0.580). A total of 779 (49.8%) patients underwent an AVI in which 145 (18.6%) died. In a multivariate Cox regression analysis, each 10 mL/s decrease in FR was associated with a 7% increase in hazard ratio (HR) for all-cause mortality (HR 1.07; 95% CI 1.03-1.11, P < 0.001). The best cut-off value of FR for prediction of all-cause mortality was 179 mL/s in women and 209 mL/s in men. Conclusion: Transaortic FR was lower in women than men. In the group undergoing AVI, lower FR was associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality, and the optimal cut-off for prediction of all-cause mortality was lower in women than men.

AB  - Background: There is uncertainty regarding whether outcomes after Cardiac Implantable Electronic Devices (CIED) differ between women and men. There are no prospectively collected data regarding Australian CIED outcomes. This study aimed to determine whether the characteristics and outcomes of Australian patients undergoing CIED implantation differ by sex. Methods: We prospectively followed 5,360 patients undergoing CIED implantation between 2015 and 2019 in a large multi-centre Australian registry. Patient characteristics, procedural data, medications and clinical outcomes to 1 year were analysed. Results: The mean age was 76.2 + 11.2 years, and 2022 (37.7%) were female. Women were older than men at device implantation (77.0 ± 11.6 years vs. 75.5 ± 10.9 years, p < 0.001). Most implants were de novo (79.7%). Pacing was more commonly for sick sinus syndrome in women than men (54.4% vs. 47.2%, p < 0.001) and less often for A-V block (28.3% vs. 35.1%, p < 0.001). Adverse events at 30 days were low compared to international cohorts, for mortality (0.06%) and major complications (0.6%). There were no significant sex differences (women vs. men) for death (HR 1.33, 95% CI 0.58–3.13, p = 0.49) or major complications (HR 1.41, 95% 95% CI 0.65–3.03, p = 0.39). At 1-year, there was no difference in major complications or risk-adjusted all-cause mortality (HR 1.05, 95% CI 0.70–1.29, p = 0.77) between women and men. Conclusions: Clinical practice and 30-day outcomes after CIED implantation in Australia are consistent with international reports. There were no differences in procedural complication rates or clinical outcomes at 1-year between women and men, regardless of age or CIED system implanted.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to assess the impact of sex on the management and outcome of patients according to aortic stenosis (AS) severity. Introduction: Sex differences in the management and outcome of AS are poorly understood. Methods: Doppler echocardiography data of patients with at least mild-to-moderate AS [aortic valve area (AVA) ≤1.5 cm2 and peak jet velocity (VPeak) ≥2.5 m/s or mean gradient (MG) ≥25 mmHg] were prospectively collected between 2005 and 2015 and retrospectively analysed. Patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (<50%), or mitral or aortic regurgitation >mild were excluded. Results: Among 3632 patients, 42% were women. The mean indexed AVA (0.48 ± 0.17 cm2/m2), VPeak (3.74 ± 0.88 m/s), and MG (35.1 ± 18.2 mmHg) did not differ between sexes (all P ≥ 0.18). Women were older (72.9 ± 13.0 vs. 70.1 ± 11.8 years) and had more hypertension (75% vs. 70%; P = 0.0005) and less coronary artery disease (38% vs. 55%, P < 0.0001) compared to men. After inverse-propensity weighting (IPW), female sex was associated with higher mortality (IPW-HR: 1.91 [1.14-3.22]; P = 0.01) and less referral to valve intervention (competitive model IPW-HR: 0.88 [0.82-0.96]; P = 0.007) in the whole cohort. This excess mortality in women was blunted in concordant non-severe AS initially treated conservatively (IPW-HR = 1.03 [0.63-1.68]; P = 0.88) or in concordant severe AS initially treated by valve intervention (IPW-HR = 1.25 [0.71-2.21]; P = 0.43). Interestingly, the excess mortality in women was observed in discordant low-gradient AS patients (IPW-HR = 2.17 [1.19-3.95]; P = 0.01) where women were less referred to valve intervention (IPW-Sub-HR: 0.83 [0.73-0.95]; P = 0.009). Conclusion: In this large series of patients, despite similar baseline hemodynamic AS severity, women were less referred to AVR and had higher mortality. This seemed mostly to occur in the patient subset with discordant markers of AS severity (i.e. low-gradient AS) where women were less referred to AVR.

AB  - Objectives: To analyze how left ventricular (LV) remodeling and hypertrophy geometry evolve after surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) in octogenarian patients, and identify potential sex-related differences and implications for long-term outcomes. Methods: In 170 patients with aortic stenosis ([AS], age 80 ± 4 years, 59% women), hypertrophy geometry and remodeling (LV index) were reanalyzed one year post-SAVR. The six-year outcomes were evaluated. Results: Pre-SAVR, 65% of the women and 38.6% of the men (P <.001) showed adaptive remodeling. Concentric hypertrophy was prevalent in adaptive remodeling, and mixed and dilated hypertrophy were more prevalent in maladaptive remodeling. At one year, the remodeling patterns and sex distribution were similar to those observed pre-SAVR, but the LV index decreased in women and increased in men (P <.0001). Women with adaptive remodeling had a higher incidence of persistent concentric hypertrophy with higher LV filling pressures. Long-term survival was better in women and worse in men with adaptive remodeling (P =.039). Men with adaptive remodeling and men with concentric hypertrophy had the highest risk of cardiac death. This risk was similar between sexes for patients with maladaptive remodeling and dilated hypertrophy. Women with LV ejection fraction >55% had a lower risk of cardiac death than men. Conclusions: The long-term outcomes of SAVR differ between sexes in older patients with AS and adaptive LV remodeling. The LV index facilitates studying the pathways of adaptation to AS. The follow-up shifts help explain the sex differences in long-term outcomes post-SAVR. Concentric hypertrophy is associated with the highest risk of cardiac death in men.

Methods. The study comprises a prospective cohort of 592 TAVI patients (53.4% female) treated between 2008 and 2018. Mortality differences between genders at different timepoints were assessed according to log rank test. Predictors of all-cause mortality at follow-up were identified using a univariate model and were then analyzed through multivariate Cox proportional hazard models. Results. Compared with female patients, males were younger (81 ± 7.5 years vs 84.3 ± 5.3 years) and presented more comorbidities. Twelve female and 8 male patients (3.5%) died in the first 30 days after TAVI. Despite a higher Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) score in women, all-cause mortality rates at 30 days and 1 year were comparable. At long-term follow-up, female patients demonstrated better survival rates, despite a higher number of periprocedural complications. Correlates identified in men were the presence of diabetes and previous history of coronary artery bypass grafting, New York Heart Association class III/IV, pulmonary artery systolic pressure, and non-transfemoral access. None of these variables remained significant in the multivariable analysis. In females, only peripheral artery disease was associated with mortality. Shock and need for renal replacement were predictors of mortality in both genders, as was heart failure readmission after discharge. STS score was also shown to correlate with long-term mortality in both genders. Conclusion. Despite a higher STS score in women, 30-day mortality was not significantly different from men, while women present better clinical outcomes at long-term follow-up.

T2  - Journal of Invasive Cardiology
AB  - Background. Chronic total occlusions (CTOs) and long lesions have been associated with higher reocclusion rates in femoropopliteal arteries and increased need for revascularization. While several studies have analyzed atherectomy samples, no study to date has correlated the tissue characteristics of CTOs with clinical outcomes. This pilot study assessed lesions in order to predict clinical outcomes based on lesion characteristics. Methods. Patients presenting with femoropopliteal (FP) CTO lesions, including in-stent restenosis and de novo lesions, were enrolled in a prospective, observational study. With patient consent, CTOs were crossed using a crossing catheter guided by optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging. Atherectomy was performed with a directional atherectomy device and tissue samples were collected and subjected to histopathological analysis for the presence of adventitial tissue and thrombus, and the amounts of hypercellular cells, fibrocellular material, fibrous tissue, and lipid-rich tissue in the excised tissue were measured. The compiled data were correlated with clinical outcomes, as recorded at each patient’s clinical follow-up visit. Results. All CTO lesions (n = 19) were successfully crossed, with no dissections or perforations. Adventitial tissue was found in excised tissue from all 19 lesions (up to 57% of total lesion area), and thrombus was found in 15 lesions (up to 34% of total lesion area). The amount of hypercellular cells, fibrocellular material, fibrous tissue, and lipid-rich tissue present in the excised tissue did not correlate with the incidence of target-lesion revascularization (TLR). At 6-month follow-up exam, 79% of the treated lesions had TLR. Risk of TLR was assessed based on weighted risk of each variable; the results determined that occurrence of TLR was associated with elevated levels of adventitia and thrombus in the lesions and with lesions >15 cm in length. There was a significant correlation (P<.05) between TLR and the lesion characterization as set forth in the present study. Conclusions. Pairing the histological analysis, including content of adventitia and thrombus, with lesion length and binary clinical outcomes enabled the predictive incidence of TLR in this pilot study. Further work needs to be conducted to validate these findings in larger studies.

AB  - Background This research aims to determine if there is a difference in mortality and its relation to sex before and after the publication of low-risk trials. Methods We queried the TriNetx database (Diamond Network). We analyzed the data using codes used for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) procedures from Jan 15, 2015, to May 3, 2020, and identified 35,001 cases performed before the publication of the TAVR low-risk trials. The pre-low-risk TAVR cohort group consisted of 19,143 males and 15,858 females. We queried additional data after the publication of the low-risk TAVR trials from May 4, 2019, to May 4, 2020, and identified 9,677 cases from the Diamond Network. The post-low-risk TAVR cohort group consisted of 5,440 males and 4,237 females. We compared all-cause mortality between propensity matched (PSM) groups. Results The pre low-risk trial cohorts had an age at implantation of 79.1±7.72 for males and 80.1±7.36 for females. At the end of three months, the endpoint of mortality was 3.2% for males and 2.7% for females (P = 0.01). The Log-Rank test was generated (P = 0.01). Meanwhile, the post-low-risk trial cohorts had an age of 78.1±8.28 for males and 79.1±8.1 for females at the time of implantation. At the end of three months, the endpoint of mortality was 2.2% for males and 1.9% for females, with a (P = 0.329). The Log-Rank test was generated (P = 0.268). Conclusion Based on this data, inclusion of low risk patients negates the higher mortality risk noted in males undergoing TAVR. [Formula presented]

AB  - Male and female aortic stenosis patients have distinct valvular phenotypes, increasing the complexities in the evaluation of valvular pathophysiology. In this study, we present cutting-edge artificial intelligence analyses of transcriptome-wide array data from stenotic aortic valves to highlight differences in gene expression patterns between the sexes, using both sex-differentiated transcripts and unbiased gene selections. This approach enabled the development of efficient models with high predictive ability and determining the most significant sex-dependent contributors to calcification. In addition, analyses of function-related gene groups revealed enriched fibrotic pathways among female patients. Ultimately, we demonstrate that artificial intelligence models can be used to accurately predict aortic valve calcification by carefully analyzing sex-specific gene transcripts.

AB  - Aims: The aims of this study were to investigate the correlation and sex differences between total valve calcium, valve calcium concentration, and aortic valve calcification (AVC) in explanted valves from patients with severe aortic valve stenosis undergoing aortic valve replacement (AVR). Methods and results: Sixty-nine patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) scheduled for elective AVR underwent echocardiography and cardiac computed tomography (CT) prior to surgery (AVCin vivo) and CT of the explanted aortic valve (AVCex vivo). Explanted valves were prepared in acid solution, sonicated, and analysed with Arsenazo III dye to estimate total valve calcium and valve calcium concentration. Median AVCex vivo was 2082 (1421-2973) AU; mean valve calcium concentration was 1.43 ± 0.42 μmol Ca2+/mg tissue; median total valve calcium 156 (111-255) mg Ca2+, and valve calcium density 52 (35-81) mg/cm2. AVC displayed a strong correlation with total valve calcium (R2 = 0.98, P < 0.001) and a moderate correlation with valve calcium concentration (R2 = 0.62, P < 0.001). Valvular calcium concentration was associated with sex, aortic valve area, and mean gradient. After adjusting for age and estimated glomerular filtration rate, sex and mean gradient remained associated with valve calcium concentrations. Conclusion: AVC score provides a strong estimate for total valve calcium but to a lesser degree calcium concentration in the valve tissue of patients with severe AS. Females presented lower valvular calcium concentrations than males irrespective of AS severity, adding evidence and providing support to the important point that sex differences in valvular calcium concentration in AS does not reflect valvular size.

AB  - Objectives: To investigate 4-year, post-transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) survival and predictors of survival by sex, in a real-world cohort that underwent transfemoral TAVI with SAPIEN 3 transcatheter heart valve. Background: Previous TAVI investigations of first-generation devices demonstrated an early- to mid-term survival advantage in women compared with men. Methods: SOURCE 3 (SAPIEN 3 Aortic Bioprosthesis European Outcome) is a post-approval, multicentre, observational registry. Patients (N = 1,694, 49.2% women, age 81.7 ± 6.7 years) with severe aortic stenosis and high surgical risk (logistic EuroSCORE 17.8%) underwent TAVI between 2014 and 2015. Kaplan–Meier event estimates were used to determine mortality by sex. Predictors of overall mortality were identified using a cox multivariate proportional hazard model. Results: At 4 years, women had lower all-cause mortality than men (36.0 vs 39.7%; p =.0911; HR: 0.87 [95% CI: 0.75–1.02]). No difference was observed for cardiac mortality between women 24.2% and men 24.7% (p =.76; HR: 0.97 [95% CI: 0.79–1.19]). When adjusted for baseline characteristics (age, height, weight, NYHA functional class, renal insufficiency, EuroScore, and tricuspid regurgitation), sex had no impact on mortality. Conclusions: In this large, real-world cohort, all-cause mortality trended lower in women than men at 4 years post TAVI; however, several baseline factors, but not sex, were predictors of mortality. No difference between sexes was observed for cardiovascular mortality.

AB  - Objectives: To assess sex differences of clinical presentation and outcomes in propensity-matched patients with acute type A aortic dissection (AAAD). Methods: We collected the clinical data of patients with AAAD from a single heart center between January 2009 and July 2014. After propensity score matching, we compared differences in clinical presentation and outcomes of patients with AAAD between men and women. Results: There were 590 patients (295 men and 295 women) with AAAD through propensity matching on demographics and patients’ history. We found that the presentation and diagnosis of AAAD often were more delayed in women. Severe signs of congestive heart failure (9.8% vs. 5.1%, P = 0.017), cardiac tamponade/shock (9.1% vs. 4.1%, P < 0.001), and periaortic hematoma (26.4% vs. 21.7%, P < 0.001) were more commonly presented in women. Surgery was more commonly performed in men than in women (95.4% (281/295) vs. 91.5% (270/295), P = 0.045), indicating the association of sex with surgical decision. To investigate the association of sex with outcomes after surgery, patients who underwent surgical treatment were re-matched (262 men and 262 women) by propensity score. Women suffered from greater in-hospital mortality than men (8.4% vs. 3.4%, P < 0.001). Postoperative complications of congestive heart failure (9.1% vs. 3.8%, P < 0.001), visceral ischemia (6.8% vs. 1.1%, P < 0.001), and limb ischemia (7.6% vs. 1.5%, P < 0.001) were more frequent in women. For women, prolonged operative time may increase in-hospital mortality, especially after 12 hours from the start of surgery (30.0% vs. 14.3%, P < 0.001). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis indicated worse late outcomes in women in the matched surgery group (log-rank P = 0.012). Conclusions: Our analysis provides new insights into sex differences in clinical presentation and outcomes of AAAD.

AB  - Since the introduction of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), there has been a paradigm shift in the management of severe aortic stenosis. While women represent almost half of the patients undergoing TAVR, there are limited data on sex-based comparisons in hospital outcomes and predictors of mortality in women and men. The National Inpatient Sample database from 2012 to 2015 was used to identify TAVR using international classification of diseases-9 clinical modification procedure codes 35.05 and 35.06. We identified 61,239 patients who underwent TAVR between 2012 and 2015. After adjusting for potential confounders, women had higher odds of all-cause mortality as compared to men [odds ratio (OR) 1.25, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.01-1.54; P = 0.036]. Moreover, women had significantly increased odds of cardiac complications [OR 2.41, 95% CI: 1.67-3.49; P ≤ 0.01], respiratory complications [OR 1.20 95% CI: 1.07-1.34; P = 0.001], major hemorrhage requiring transfusion [OR 1.51, 95% CI: 1.37-1.67; P ≤ 0.001], neurological complications [OR 1.38, 95% CI: 0.95-1.99; P = 0.08], need for vasopressor treatment [OR 1.33, 95% CI: 1.01-1.75; P = 0.04], and vascular complications [OR 1.73, 95% CI: 1.19-2.52; P = 0.004]. On the contrary, the odds of pacemaker requirement [OR 0.85, 95% CI: 0.75-0.97; P = 0.02], and acute kidney injury [OR 0.80, 95% CI: 0.71-0.91; P = 0.001] were significantly lower in women. Among patients undergoing TAVR, women were more likely to have in-hospital complications and mortality as compared with men. Further studies are needed to identify the discrepancy in in-hospital outcomes with sex-specific factors being considered.

AB  - Objectives Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is increasingly performed. Physically small Asians have smaller aortic root and peripheral vessel anatomy. The influence of gender of Asian patients undergoing TAVR is unknown and may affect outcomes. The aim of this study was to assess sex differences in Asian patients undergoing TAVR. Methods Patients undergoing TAVR from eight countries were enrolled. In this retrospective analysis, we examined differences in characteristics, 30-day clinical outcomes and 1-year survival between female and male Asian patients. Results Eight hundred and seventy-three patients (54.4% women) were included. Women were older, smaller and had less coronary artery and lung disease but tended to have higher logistic EuroSCOREs. Smaller prostheses were used more often in women. Major vascular complications occurred more frequently in women (5.5% vs 1.8%, p<0.01); however, 30-day stroke and mortality (women vs men: 1.5% vs 1.6%, p=0.95% and 4.3% vs 3.4%, p=0.48) were similar. Functional status improvement was significant and comparable between the sexes. Conduction disturbance and permanent pacemaker requirements (11.2% vs 9.0%, p=0.52) were also similar as was 1-year survival (women vs men: 85.6% vs 88.2%, p=0.25). The only predictors of 30-day mortality were major vascular injury in women and age in men. Conclusions Asian women had significantly smaller stature and anatomy with some differences in clinical profiles. Despite more frequent major vascular complications, women had similar 30-day stroke or mortality rates. Functional status improvement was significant and comparable between the sexes. Conduction disturbance and permanent pacemaker requirements were similar as was 1-year survival.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although women represent half of the population burden of aortic stenosis (AS), little is known whether sex affects the presentation, management, and outcome of patients with AS. METHODS AND RESULTS: In a cohort of 2429 patients with severe AS (49.5% women) we aimed to evaluate 5-year excess mortality and performance of aortic valve replacement (AVR) stratified by sex. At presentation, women were older (P<0.001), with less comorbidities (P=0.030) and more often symptomatic (P=0.007) than men. Women had smaller aortic valve area (P<0.001) than men but similar mean transaortic pressure gradient (P=0.18). The 5-year survival was lower compared with expected survival, especially for women (62±2% versus 71% for women and 69±1% versus 71% for men). Despite longer life expectancy in women than men, women had lower 5-year survival than men (66±2% [expected-75%] versus 68±2% [expected-70%], P<0.001) after matching for age. Overall, 5-year AVR incidence was 79±2% for men versus 70±2% for women (P<0.001) with male sex being independently associated with more frequent early AVR performance (odds ratio, 1.49; 1.18-1.97). After age matching, women remained more often symptomatic (P=0.004) but also displayed lower AVR use (64.4% versus 69.1%; P=0.018). CONCLUSIONS: Women with severe AS are diagnosed at later ages and have more symptoms than men. Despite prevalent symptoms, AVR is less often performed in women and 5-year excess mortality is noted in women versus men, even after age matching. These imbalances should be addressed to ensure that both sexes receive equivalent care for severe AS.

AB  - Background: Gender differences in valvular heart disease are increasingly recognised. A prior study has suggested better surgical outcomes in women with symptomatic aortic stenosis (AS). We investigate gender differences in medically managed severe AS. Method: We studied 347 patients with severe AS (aortic valve area index <0.6 cm2/m2) in terms of baseline clinical background, echocardiographic characteristics, and clinical outcomes. Appropriate univariate and multivariate models were employed, while Kaplan–Meier curves were constructed to compare mortality outcomes. Results: In total, 205 (59%) patients were women. Despite higher incidences of hypertension (75.6% vs 47.3%) and diabetes mellitus (46.5% vs 29.5%) in women, women had improved survival (Kaplan–Meier log-rank = 6.24, p = 0.012). After adjusting for age (hazard ratio [HR], 1.034; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.014–1.054), hypertension (HR, 1.469; 95% CI, 0.807–2.673), diabetes (HR, 1.219; 95% CI, 0.693–2.145), and indexed aortic valve area (HR 0.145, 95% CI 0.031–0.684) on multivariate analyses, female gender remained independently associated with lower mortality (HR, 0.561; 95%, CI 0.332–0.947). Women tended to have smaller body surface area (BSA), left ventricular (LV) internal diastolic diameter, and smaller LV outflow tract diameter but were similar to men in terms of LV ejection fraction, AS severity, and patterns of LV remodelling. Conclusions: Women appeared to have better outcomes compared to men in medically managed severe AS. These gender differences warrant further study and may affect prognosis, follow-up, and timing of valve surgery.

T2  - Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine
AB  - Females suffer higher operative (30-day) mortality than males after surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR). In contrast, outcomes after trans-catheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) seem to favor females, both in terms of procedural mortality, and more prominently, medium to long-term survival. With an ever-greater number of TAVR procedures being performed, an understanding of factors responsible for gender differences in outcomes after the two AVR modalities is critical for better patient selection. Current evidence suggests that this gender difference in outcomes after SAVR and TAVR stems from differences in baseline risk profiles, as well as inherent anatomic/physiological differences between genders. This review attempts to examine these clinical and physiological factors, with a goal of guiding better patient selection for each AVR modality, and to highlight areas that beg further investigation.

AB  - Aims: Increasing attention has been paid to sex differences in recent studies, but only a few have focused on such differences in aortic stenosis (AS). We sought to evaluate the differences between genders in AS outcomes and management. Methods and results: We included 2429 patients(51.5% men; 49.5% women) with severe AS. Women were olde r(P < 0.001), more often symptomatic(P = 0.007), and presented with smaller aortic valve area(P < 0.001), and greater ejection fraction(P < 0.001) than men. Despite that women have a longer life expectancy than men in the general population, estimated five-year survival of patients with severe AS was lower for women compared to men(62 ± 2% versus 69 ± 1% respectively, P < 0.001). The 5-year survival was lower compared to expected survival, especially for women (62 ± 2% vs. 71% for women and 69 ± 1% vs. 71% for men). The cumulative 5-years incidence of aortic valve replacement (AVR) was 79 ± 2% for men, and only 70 ± 2% for women (P < 0.001) and, being male was independently predictive of AVR (OR:1.49 [1.18–1.97]; P = 0.011). After age-matching, women still presented with more symptoms (P = 0.004), lower AVR rates (64.4% versus 69.1%, P = 0.018) and lower 5-year survival than men (66 ± 2%[expected:75%] versus 68 ± 2% [expected 70%], P < 0.001) (Fig. 1). Conclusion: Women with severe AS present at a more advance stage of the disease, at older ages with more symptoms, and incur higher mortality than men. This excess mortality is related to a combination of late diagnosis and a less frequent and later referral for AVR than in men. This justifies appropriate measures to improve the situation and to ensure that both sexes receive equivalent care.

AB  - Introduction: Despite the establishment of multiple factors influencing short- and mid-term outcomes in patients treated with transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI), the real-world data on the association between gender and outcomes after TAVI remain conflicting. Aim: To evaluate the association of female gender with the clinical and periprocedural characteristics along with in-hospital, short- and medium-term outcomes of patients treated with TAVI in comparison with male patients. Material and methods: Data from the prospective, single-centre registry of consecutive patients with severe AS referred for TAVI from 26 November 2008 to 31 December 2018 were analysed retrospectively. The study population comprised 275 patients who were divided by gender. The primary endpoint of the study was all-cause mortality at 1 year. Results: Women constituted 132 (48.0%) of the overall population. Women were significantly older, but had a significantly higher left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and had less frequently undergone coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) before TAVI. The implantation success rate was comparable between genders, but women less frequently required implantation of a pacemaker after TAVI, although they more frequently required blood transfusion due to severe bleeding. The primary endpoint occurred in 13.6% of women and 7.7% of men (p = 0.12). Conclusions: Despite advanced age and prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors, the overall short- and medium-term mortality in patients treated with TAVI in our analysis of the real-world population remains relatively low. Although women seemed to have a slightly better clinical baseline profile, their in-hospital, 30-day, 6-month and 12-month outcomes did not differ significantly from the male patients.

AB  - Background: The effect of sex on mortality is controversial; furthermore, sex differences in left ventricular (LV) remodeling after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) remain unknown. Methods and Results: This study included 2,588 patients (1,793 [69.3%] female) enrolled in the Optimized CathEter vAlvular iNtervention (OCEAN)-TAVI Japanese multicenter registry between October 2013 and May 2017. We retrospectively analyzed the effect of sex on mortality, and evaluated changes in the LV mass index (LVMI) after TAVI. Female sex was significantly associated with lower all-cause and cardiovascular mortality (log-rank P<0.001 for both). Multivariate analysis showed that female sex was independently associated with lower cumulative long-term mortality (hazard ratio 0.615; 95% confidence interval 0.512–0.738; P<0.001). Regression in the LVMI was observed in both sexes, and there was no significant difference in the percentage LVMI regression from baseline to 1 year after TAVI between women and men. Women had a survival advantage compared with men among patients with LVMI regression at 1 year, but not among patients with no LVMI regression. Conclusions: We found that female sex is associated with better survival outcomes after TAVI in a large Japanese registry. Although LVMI regression was observed in women and men after TAVI, post-procedural LV mass regression may be related to the sex differences in mortality.

AB  - Female gender has been linked to increased risk of adverse events after surgical aortic valve replacement but with better outcome after TAVI. Less is known regarding functional capacity between the genders with severe AS. We investigated whether there is a gender difference in functional capacity in asymptomatic group of patients with severe AS. Method: Asymptomatic patients with severe AS were prospectively enrolled and underwent cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) on supine ergobicycle, ramp protocol, 15 W/min. Patients with test positive for ischemia were excluded. Results: There were 139 patients, 61 women. There were no baseline gender differences in age (66.11 vs 64.8, p = ns), echo parameters of AS severity (Vmax 4.53 vs 4.53 m/s, and Pmean 52.27 vs 53.42 mmHg, all p = ns) except AVA (0.75 ± 0.1 vs 0.63 ± 0.17), LVEF (68.7 vs 71.6%), E/e’ (12.6 vs 14.3) and BNP (92.5 vs 103 pg/ml), all p = ns. Women had higher body mass index (29.5 vs 27.3, p = 0.018), lower VO2max (13.10 vs 17.6 ml/kg/m2, p = 0.001) and higher VE/VCO2 slope (33.69 vs 28.87, p = 0.004). Univariable/multivariable linear regression analyses were used to test the relation between clinical and echocardiographic characteristics with VO2max. The variables independently associated with the VO2max were female gender (beta = –0.365, p = 0.002), Vmax (beta= –0.341, p = 0.004), age (beta = –0.239, p = 0.035) and BMI (beta = –0.246, p = 0.028) Conclusion: Female gender is the strongest independent predictor of decreased functional capacity, even when adjusting for other variables, including BMI and echo markers of AS severity. Further studies are needed to determine whether this finding affects the outcome of the disease.

AB  - Background: Currently, far more than 1.2 - 2.7 million adults with congenital heart disease (ACHD) are expected to live across Europe. Although there is sufficient evidence that sex-/gender-based differences can influence treatment decisions and healthcare for adults with congenital heart disease (ACHD), there are major research shortfalls in this regard. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess gender-specific differences in a large ACHD cohort Methods: This cross-sectional, questionnaire-based study included 3,880 ACHD (53.6% female; 41.9 ±17.1 [range: 18 - 86] years). Gender-related differences concerning diagnosis, comorbidities, the medical health care situation, individual need for counselling and quality of life (QOL) were assessed by patient reported outcome measures (PROM). Results: Significant differences were observed included a female predominance in tetralogy of Fallot (p<.001), atrial septal defects(p<.001), and persistent ductus arteriosus (p=.028), and a male predominance in aortic valve stenosis/insufficiency (p=.001) and transposition of the great arteries (p<.001). The prevalence of coronary artery disease was significantly higher in men (p<.001), while women reported a higher prevalence of pulmonary hypertension (p<.001), cardiac arrhythmias (p<.001), and mental impairments (p=.003). Male patients with CHD consulted their general practitioners (GP) more often than woman, if a medical problem concerning the CHD was suspected (52% vs. 48%; p<.001). A total of 2,194 patients (54.4% of them female) stated that they had never been referred to an institution specialized in CHD. Both sexes had a high counselling demand, but there were significant differences between male and female participants (see table). In terms of QoL, female participants reported greater impairments, especially in everyday activities, more pain/physical complaints, and more anxiety/depression. Conclusion: There are major gender differences in patients with CHD. Based on the PROMs, gender differences in diagnosis, comorbidities, medical care, counselling needs and QOL must be considered in future medical treatment. In addition to CHD specialists, GPs must be sensitized about the importance of gender differences in ACHD, since they are the first contact persons when it comes to medical questions for the majority of ACHD, especially for men.

AB  - PURPOSE: Postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF) after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) has been associated with increased risk of death in women but not in men. We aimed to explore predictors and long-term mortality in POAF following isolated aortic valve replacement (AVR) surgery in men and women. METHODS: This study included 379 severe aortic stenosis patients with no prior atrial fibrillation (AF) who underwent isolated AVR surgery. We used multiple logistic regression to investigate independent gender-specific predictors of new-onset POAF, and we performed Kaplan-Meier (KM) to determine the impact of POAF in long-term mortality according to gender. RESULTS: Advanced age and coronary artery disease prevalence were higher among POAF patients in both genders. On multiple analysis, increased postoperative peak lactate was independently associated with POAF in men, while lower mean aortic valve gradient was associated with POAF in women. Area under the curve (AUC) for the model was 0.77 [0.68-0.86] and 0.69 [0.60-0.78] for men and women, respectively. At 4-year follow-up, POAF was linked to increased risk of death in men but not in women. CONCLUSION: In severe aortic stenosis, factors associated with POAF and its impact on mortality differed between genders, with an increased risk of death observed only in men.

AB  - (1) Background: Mitral regurgitation (MR) is the second most prevalent valvular heart disease in developed countries. Mitral valve (MV) disease is a common cause of heart failure and a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the U.S.A. and Europe. (2) Methods: We performed a retrospective study using the Spanish National Hospital Discharge Database, 2001–2015. We included patients that had surgical mitral valve replacement (SMVR) listed as a procedure in their discharge report. We sought to (i) examine trends in incidence of SMVR among women and men in Spain, (ii) compare in-hospital outcomes for mechanical and bioprosthetic SMVR by sex, and (iii) identify factors associated with in-hospital mortality (IHM) after SMVR. (3) Results: We identified 44,340 hospitalizations for SMVR (84% mechanical, 16% bioprosthetic). The incidence of SMVR was higher in women (IRR 1.51; 95% CI 1.48–1.54). The use of mechanical SMVR decreased over time in both sexes and the use of bioprosthetic valves increased over time in both sexes. Men who underwent mechanical and bioprosthetic SMVR had higher comorbidity than women. IHM was significantly lower in women who underwent SMVR than in men (10% vs. 12% p < 0.001 for mechanical and 14% vs. 16% p = 0.025 for bioprosthetic valve, respectively). Major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) were also significantly lower in women who underwent mechanical and bioprosthetic SMVR. A significant reduction in both in-hospital MACCEs and IHM was observed over the study period regardless of sex. After multivariable logistic regression, male sex was associated with increased IHM only in bioprosthetic SMVR (OR 1.28; 95% CI 1.1–1.5). (4) Conclusions: This nationwide analysis over 15 years of sex-specific outcomes after SMVR showed that incidences are significantly higher in women than men for mechanical and bioprosthetic SMVR. IHM and MACCE have improved over time for SMVR in both sexes. Male sex was independently associated with higher mortality after bioprosthetic SMVR.

AB  - Background: The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between baseline left ventricular (LV) geometry and outcomes after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Methods: Patients undergoing TAVR (n = 206) had baseline LV geometry classified as (1) concentric hypertrophy, (2) eccentric hypertrophy, (3) concentric remodeling, or (4) normal. Descriptive statistics, Kaplan-Meier time-to-event analysis, and Cox regression were performed. Results: Distribution of baseline LV geometry differed between male and female patients (χ2 = 16.83, P = .001) but not at 1 month (χ2 = 2.56, P = .47) or 1 year (χ2 = 5.68, P = .13). After TAVR, a majority of patients with concentric hypertrophy evolved to concentric remodeling. Survival differed across LV geometry groups at 1 year (χ2[3] = 8.108, P = .044, log-rank test) and at 6.5 years (χ2[3] = 9.023, P = .029, log-rank test). Compared with patients with concentric hypertrophy, patients with normal geometry (hazard ratio, 2.25; 95% CI, 1.12–4.54; P = .023) and concentric remodeling (hazard ratio, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.12–3.17; P = .016) had higher rates of all-cause mortality. Conclusions: Baseline concentric hypertrophy confers a survival advantage after TAVR. Although baseline patterns of LV geometry appear gender specific (with women demonstrating more concentric hypertrophy), this difference resolves after TAVR.

AB  - Introduction: Recent studies have demonstrated the predictive value of preprocedural cardiac biomarkers, such as N-terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and high-sensitivity troponin T (hsTnT), in patients with severe aortic valve stenosis undergoing valve replacement. Nonetheless, it remains still unclear whether hsTnT may be influenced by genderspecific differences. Purpose: The aim of this subanalysis was to evaluate sex-related differences of preprocedural hsTnT in predicting postoperative long-term survival in a large cohort undergoing either surgical or transcatheter aortic valve replacement. Methods: The TASS-2 group, a consortium of four university hospital centers, analysed 3595 consecutively enrolled patients admitted for valve implantation because of severe aortic stenosis between 2007 and 2017. Results: The study cohort consisted of 1728 (48.1%) female and 1867 (51.9%) male patients. During a median follow-up of 2.9 years, cardiovascular mortality was found in 556 (15.5%) patients, amongst whom were 292 (16.9%) women and 264 (14.1%) men. All-cause mortality was detected in 919 (25.6%) patients dividing into 462 (26.7%) women and 457 (24.5%) men. Preprocedural hsTnT was significantly higher (p<0.001) in male (19 ng/l, 11.8-34.0) than in female (16 ng/l, 10.0-30.0) patients. In contrary, NTproBNP was lower (p=0.002) in male (1286 ng/l, 444.5-3225.5) than female (1407 ng/l, 604.5-3217.5) patients. For the univariate analysis of survival, hsTnT was categorized by using predefined subgroups (<5 ng/l; 5-13.99 ng/l; 14-50 ng/l; >50 ng/l). Cardiovascular and all-cause mortality were significantly increased with higher hsTnT plasma levels in women (p<0.001) as well as in men (<0.001). In two separate multivariate cox regression models, one for either gender -adjusting for STS risk score, NT-proBNP plasma levels, degree of left ventricular systolic dysfunction, atrial fibrillation, age, renal function, chronic obstructive pneumonic disease, arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus, concomitant significant coronary artery disease and type of procedure-pre-procedural hsTnT was a strong independent predictor for postoperative cardiovascular mortality with an hazard ratio [HR] of 3.34, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.03-10.80, P=0.044 for mildly to moderately elevated hsTnT (14-50 ng/l) and an HR of 3.98, CI 1.19-13.30, P=0.025 for severely elevated hsTnT (>50 ng/l) in women, whereas an hazard ratio [HR] 4.09, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.55-29.99, P=0.166 for mildly to moderately elevated hsTnT (14-50 ng/l) and an HR 7.48, CI 0.99-56.12, P=0.050 for severely elevated hsTnT (>50 ng/l) in men was yielded. Conclusion: Long-term postoperative survival in patients with severe AS admitted for valve implantation was independently predicted by hsTnT, irrespective of gender.

AB  - Risk stratification as well as treatment decision in asymptomatic patients with isolated severe aortic stenosis (AS) is matter of ongoing debate. It has been known that gender-specific difference in left ventricular reaction to AS exists. Female gender has also been linked to increased risk of adverse events after surgical AVR but with better outcome after TAVI. We investigated whether there is a gender difference in functional capacity in asymptomatic patients with isolated severe AS. Asymptomatic patients with severe AS were prospectively enrolled and underwent cardiopulmonary stress-echocardiography exercise testing (ESECPET) on supine ergobicycle, ramp protocol, 15 W/min. Patients with ischemia positive test were excluded (ECG and/or echo) There were 139 patients, 61 women. There were no gender differences in age (66.36 vs 67.37, p=ns), echo parameters (Vmax 4.54 vs 4.48m/s, AVA 0.62 vs 0.68cm2, and Pmean 52.6 vs 53.8mmHg, all p=ns), LVEF (68.56 vs 70.90%, p=ns), e/E' (12.74 vs 14.45, p=ns), BNP (112.51 vs 110.55 pg/ml, p=ns) and valvulo-arterial impedance (4.65 vs 5.14mm Hg ml-1 m2, p=0.07). Women had higher body mass index (29.05 vs 26.95, p=0.022), lower VO2max (12.96 vs 17.93 ml/kg/m2, p=0.001) and higher VE/VCO2 slope (33.69 vs 29.01, p=0.003). Univariable and multivariable linear regression analysis were used to test the relation between various clinical and echocardiographic parameters and VO2max. The variables independently associated with the VO2max are shown in table 1, with female gender being the strongest independent predictor of VO2max Conclusion: Female gender is independent predictor of decreased functional capacity, even when adjusting for other variables, including BMI and echo markers of AS severity. Further studies are needed to determine whether this finding affects the course and outcome of the disease.

AB  - Background: LDLr−/−/ApoB100/100/IGF-II+/− mice are used as a calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) model. However, normal aortic valve hemodynamics i.e. remotely from CAVD onset and the sex-related differences are poorly known. Methods and results: Four groups of mice, intact males (IM, n = 49) and females (IF, n = 50), castrated males (CxM, n = 79) and ovariectomized females (OxF: 73), underwent a Doppler-echocardiography at 12 weeks of age. Gonadectomy was performed at 8 weeks. Aortic valve assessment using effective orifice area (EOA, using the continuity equation) and peak aortic transvalvular velocity (VPeak) was feasible in 89% of the mice with good to excellent reliability (intraclass correlation coefficients ranging from 0.90 to 0.98, p < 0.001). Mean VPeak was 104 ± 17 cm/s and mean EOA was 1.18*10−2 ± 0.22*10−2 cm2. EOA indexed to body surface area was 1.5 ± 0.3 cm2/m2. The 95th percentile of Vpeak was 132 cm/s and the 5th percentile of indexed EOA was 1.0 cm2/m2. Interestingly, IM had the highest VPeak (114 ± 14 cm/s) vs each of the other groups (CxM: 106 ± 19 cm/s, OxF: 97 ± 13 cm/s and IF: 96 ± 12 cm/s, ANOVA and corrected p < 0.001). This was mostly explained by a higher stroke volume (ANOVA and corrected p < 0.001) in IM compared to other groups. There were no major sex-differences in ventricular systolic function parameters. Conclusion: In LDLr−/−/ApoB100/100/IGF-II CAVD mice model, an aortic EOA <0.8*10−2 cm2 (or indexed EOA <1.0cm2/m2), and a peak aortic valve velocity > 132 cm/s may be proposed as thresholds to define CAVD. Intact male mice appear to have higher velocities.

AB  - Background: The prognostic value of aortic valve calcification (AVC) measured by using multidetector computed tomography imaging has been well validated in native aortic stenosis, and sex-specific thresholds have been proposed. However, few data are available regarding the impact of leaflet calcification on outcomes after biological aortic valve replacement (AVR). Objectives: The goal of this study was to analyze the association of quantitative bioprosthetic leaflet AVC with hemodynamic and clinical outcomes, as well as its possible interaction with sex. Methods: From 2008 to 2010, a total of 204 patients were prospectively enrolled with a median of 7.0 years (interquartile range: 5.1 to 9.2 years) after biological surgical AVR. AVC measured by using the Agatston method was indexed to the cross-sectional area of aortic annulus measured by echocardiography to calculate the AVC density (AVCd). Presence of hemodynamic valve deterioration (HVD; increase in mean gradient [MG] ≥10 mm Hg and/or increase in transprosthetic regurgitation ≥1) was assessed by echocardiography in 137 patients at the 3-year follow-up. The primary clinical endpoint was mortality or aortic valve re-intervention. Results: There was no significant sex-related difference in the relationship between bioprosthetic AVCd and the progression of MG. Baseline AVCd showed an independent association with HVD at 3 years. During follow-up, there were 134 (65.7%) deaths (n = 100) or valve re-interventions (n = 47). AVCd ≥58 AU/cm2 was independently associated with an increased risk of mortality or aortic valve re-intervention (adjusted hazard ratio: 2.23; 95% confidence interval: 1.44 to 3.35; p < 0.001). The AVCd threshold combined with an MG progression threshold of 10 mm Hg amplified the stratification of patients at risk (log-rank, p < 0.001). The addition of AVCd threshold into the prediction model including traditional risk factors improved outcome prediction (net classification improvement: 0.25, p = 0.04; likelihood ratio test, p < 0.001). Conclusions: Aortic bioprosthetic leaflet calcification is strongly and independently associated with HVD and the risk of death or aortic valve re-intervention. As opposed to native aortic stenosis, there is no sex-related differences in the relationship between AVCd and hemodynamic or clinical outcomes.

AB  - Background: Contemporary studies have the imperative to investigate important sex-related differences. Methods and Results: A total of 7608 patients (24.5% female) underwent either coronary artery bypass (CAB, n=5263, 20.9% women versus 79.1% men), isolated aortic valve replacement (AVR, n=1374, 37.6% women versus 62.4% men) or combined CAB/AVR (n=971, 25.2% women versus 74.8% men), at a single institution between 1999 and 2017. We compared sex-related differences for in-hospital mortality and a composite outcome of major post-operative morbidities (“COMP” = reoperation, stroke, renal failure, sternal wound infection, prolonged ventilation). Multivariable logistic regressions were performed to identify independent predictors of mortality and morbidity. We also compared the sex-related differences between the first and the second decade of the study. Women experienced higher overall rates of mortality (4% versus 2%; p<0.0001) and COMP (12% versus 9%; p<0.01). Increasing operative complexity was associated with widening the gap in outcomes between women and men. The differences in CAB mortality (increase of 2.1% for women, P<0.0001) and morbidity (increase of 2.2% for women, P=0.02) were higher for women. For isolated AVR, a similar trend was observed (increase of 2.2% for mortality in women, P=0.4). When CAB was combined with AVR, these differences became more apparent for both mortality (increase of 4.7% for women, P=0.005) and morbidity (increase of 6.9% for women, P=0.02). In the first decade of the study, the overall rate of mortality was 5.1% for women versus 2.3% for men (P<0.0001). In the second decade, the rate of mortality was 3.5% for women and 1.6% for men (P<0.0001). The change between both decades was not statistically significant for women (P=0.08) but was significantly lower for men (P=0.04). On multivariable analyses, female sex was an independent predictor of mortality (odds ratio, 2.3; P<0.001), and of composite outcome of major morbidities (odds ratio 1.3; P<0.01). Conclusion: Women experience worse outcomes after the most common cardiac procedures such as CAB and AVR; these gaps widen with increased operative complexity. Despite advancements in cardiac surgical care in the last decade, women remain at higher risk than men. Further studies should investigate this difference in sex-related outcomes.

AU  - Dodd, J.D.

T2  - Radiology
AB  - Cardiac imaging is becoming commonplace throughout radiology practices and is increasingly important in large-cohort prospective cardiovascular trials and in statements and guidelines. In this review, the authors summarize some of the most important imaging findings relevant to clinical practice in the past year. Key coronary CT angiography studies have included rigorous meta-analysis of its diagnostic accuracy, prognostic implications of adverse coronary plaque features, and sex differences. The value of CT for catheter-delivered valve implantation (eg, transcatheter aortic and mitral valve replacements) was further elucidated in large-cohort outcome trials. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy registries have revealed distinct clinical and MRI phenotypes, highlighting different underlying causes, while others clarified the prognostic usefulness of MRI in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and Fabry disease. Artificial intelligence and/or machine learning was applied to many aspects of cardiovascular imaging, while evidence of the benefits of both adenosine stress perfusion cardiac MRI and coronary CT angiography–derived fractional flow reserve from real-world trials has increased. Studies on vaping and vascular endothelial function and the whole-body MRI depiction of metabolic syndrome consequences were also noteworthy. Although this review focuses on Radiology articles, key articles from high-impact clinical journals are also included. Although not possible to detail all articles because of space limitations, the authors attempted to highlight those with the most pragmatic and scientific value.

AB  - Background: Females have historically been underrepresented in cardiovascular device trials. As a result, differences in outcomes for males and females are not possible to be determined in subanalyses. Materials and Methods: Against a backdrop of troubling trends in cardiovascular outcomes for females, we provide a narrative review on the differences in outcomes observed in females undergoing device evaluations in multiple fields of cardiovascular medicine, including coronary revascularization, structural heart disease, and heart failure. We also review predictors of cardiovascular trial nonparticipation as it may provide avenues by which female enrollment in cardiovascular device trials can be improved. Results: Advances have been made in structural heart therapy, where female representation in transcatheter aortic valve replacement studies was nearly 50%. For other indications, coronary revascularization and heart failure, there was clearly a disparity in female recruitment. On average, female representation was 25% in major clinical trials evaluating drug eluting stents, implantable cardioverter defibrillators, cardiac resynchronization defibrillators, and ventricular assist devices. As a result, the best treatment recommendations for females in these fields are currently guided by outcomes evaluated primarily in males. Conclusions: Female enrollment in device clinical trials for coronary revascularization and heart failure has lagged, leaving uncertainty in making benefit/risk assessments of device therapy. The predictors of female nonparticipation in clinical trials can inform a comprehensive strategy to facilitate and enrich the enrollment of females in cardiovascular device trials. This is critical to ensure that sex differences can be considered in treatment selection, so that patients can receive the best available care.

AB  - Background: Currently, far more than 1.2 - 2.7 million adults with congenital heart disease (ACHD) are expected to live across Europe. There are major research gaps regarding gender differences in patients with congenital heart defects (CHD), although there is evidence, that gender differences can influence treatment decisions and medical health care. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to assess and evaluate gender-specific differences in a large ACHD cohort. Methods: This cross-sectional, questionnaire-based study included 1597 ACHD (53.1% female; 37.5 ± 13.1 [18 - 86] years). Gender-related differences concerning diagnosis, comorbidities, the medical health care situation, individual need for counselling and quality of life (QOL) were assessed by patient reported outcome measures (PROM) from February to October 2018. Results: Significant differences were observed concerning the patient reported gender distribution with a female predominance in tetralogy of Fallot (p<.001), atrial septal defect (p<.001) and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (p=.028) and a male predominance in coarctation of the aorta (p<.001) and aortic valve stenosis/ insufficiency (p=.001). The prevalence of comorbidities was significantly higher in men (p<.001), whereas women reported pulmonary hypertension (p<.001), cardiac arrhythmia (p<.001) and mental impairment (p=.003) more often. Male patients with CHD consulted their general practitioners (GP) more often than woman, if a medical problem concerning the CHD was suspected (52% vs. 48%; p<.001). A total of 772 patients (403 female) stated that they had never been referred to an institution specialized in CHD. 36% of all respondents had no awareness of CHD specialized institutions (no gender differences). Both sexes had a high demand for counselling (see Table 1). In terms of QOL, women reported greater impairments than men, especially in the dimensions of everyday activities, pain/ physical complaints and anxiety/ depression (p<.001). This resulted in a generally lower perceived QOL in woman (77.0 ± 18.1) than men (79.3 ± 16.4) respectively (p=.01). (Table Presented) Conclusion: There are major gender differences in patients with CHD. Based on the PROMs, gender differences in diagnosis, comorbidities, medical care, counselling needs and QOL must be considered in future medical treatment. In addition to CHD specialists, GPs must be sensitised about the importance of gender differences in ACHD, since they are the first contact persons when it comes to medical questions for the majority of ACHD, especially for men.

In randomized studies and registries, female and male patients are at a similar rate of half. Although some studies indicate that female patients have lower mortality and complication rates, the gender effect of TAVI has not been fully elucidated. In this study, we wanted to evaluate the difference between the genders in TAVI in our preliminary results. Methods: A total of 416 patients with severe symptomatic AS, and high or prohibitive operative risk underwent TAVI at our institution between June 2011 and December 2017. TAVI patients were grouped as male and female. Results: Of 416 TAVI patients, 58% of the patients were female and the mean age of women was 78.6±7.5 years and the mean age of men was 60 76.3±8.2 years and there was a statistically significant difference. Baseline characteristics and procedural details of groups which are shown in Table. BMI, STS scores, LVEF, aortic mean gradient and left ventricular hypertrophy were significantly higher in females and CABG, CAD rates and aortic valve area were significantly higher in males (p<0.001). In 30-day and one-year follow-up, patients have improvement in functional capacity with no moderate or severe PVL seen in two genders but the increase in LVEF was statistically higher in females. Permanent pacemaker rates were similar in both genders and major vascular complications were significantly higher in women. While in-hospital mortality was statistically higher in females (p=0.003), 1-month and 1-year mortality rates were similar in both genders. Conclusion: The main finding of this study is that although mortality and complications rates are higher in women post TAVI, similar rates are observed in both genders in the medium and long term.

AB  - Calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) is the most common valvular heart disease in developed countries predominantly affecting the elderly population therefore posing a large economic burden. It is a gradually progressive condition ranging from mild valve calcification and thickening, without the hemodynamic obstruction, to severe calcification impairing leaflet motion, known as aortic stenosis (AS). The progression of CAVD occurs over many years, and it is extremely variable among individuals. It is also associated with an increased risk of coronary events and mortality. The recent insights into the CAVD pathophysiology included an important role of sex. Accumulating evidence suggests that, in patients with CAVD, sex can determine important differences in the relationship between valvular calcification process, fibrosis, and aortic stenosis hemodynamic severity between men and women. Consequently, it has implications on the development of different valvular phenotypes, left ventricular hypertrophy, and cardiovascular outcomes in men and women. Along these lines, taking into account the sex-related differences in diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment outcomes is of profound importance. In this review, the sex-related differences in patients with CAVD, in terms of pathobiology, clinical phenotypes, and outcomes were discussed.

Observational data suggest that early- A nd long-term outcomes of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) differ significantly between men and women, but have demonstrated conflicting results. This study sought to examine early- A nd long-term mortality with TAVR and SAVR in women versus men. Methods. Electronic search was performed until February 2018 for studies reporting sex-specific mortality following TAVR or isolated SAVR. Data were pooled using random-effects models. Outcomes included rates of early mortality (in hospital or 30 days) and long term (1 year or longer). Results. With 35 studies, a total of 80,928 patients were included in our systematic review and meta-analysis, including 40,861 men and 40,067 women. Pooled analyses suggested considerable sex-related differences in longterm mortality following TAVR and SAVR. Following SAVR, women had higher long-term mortality (odds ratio [OR], 1.35; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.16-1.56; P<.001) and a trend toward higher early mortality (OR, 1.69; 95% CI, 0.97-2.97; P=.07) compared to men. Following TAVR, women had lower long-term mortality (OR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.71-0.86; P<.001) and no difference in early mortality (OR, 1.09; 95% CI, 0.96-1.23; P=.17) compared to men. Conclusions. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, women had higher long-term mortality and a trend toward higher early mortality compared to men following SAVR. Following TAVR, women had lower long-term mortality and no difference in early mortality compared with men.

AB  - Aortic stenosis (AS) is a common valve disorder in an ageing population in western countries, and women, with longer life expectancy, comprise a substantial percentage of elderly patients with AS. Compared with men, women exhibit distinctive characteristics at the level of stenotic valve leaflets and subsequent compensatory responses of the left ventricle to chronic pressure overload, and in clinical presentation, consequences and response to intervention. Randomised controlled trials of transcatheter aortic valve implantation have yielded new evidence of sex differences in both short-term and long-term outcomes after intervention. A comprehensive knowledge of the existing evidence may inform our understanding of gender differences during assessment and treatment of patients with AS. In this paper, we review the available evidence regarding sex differences in AS in terms of symptoms, clinical presentation, anatomical differences and pathophysiological progression, management and outcomes after aortic valve replacement. Implications for further research are suggested.

AB  - Aortic stenosis (AS) is a progressive and degenerative disease that necessitates valve replacement through either surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) or transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Various studies have shown that, unlike for TAVR, SAVR is associated with an elevated risk for women as compared to men. The aim of this review is to better understand the risks and their possible causes, associated with the use of both TAVR and SAVR in female patients. Our systematic review included studies published between 2012 and 2020, identified through specific searches of PubMed. Compatibility of publications, determined by the use of pre-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria, resulted in 15 articles being used in our review. Overall, more men than women undergo SAVR, but our findings confirmed that SAVR is associated with worse outcomes in women in the short-term. Reasons for a higher 30-day mortality post-SAVR in women include an increased age, higher in-hospital mortality and, possibly baseline comorbidities and anatomical differences. There was no difference observed in 30-day mortality between men and women undergoing TAVR. Female patients appear to have a better longer-term survival post-TAVR than their male counterparts. Understanding the reasons why women have worse outcomes post-SAVR is essential for ensuring appropriate treatment selection for patients with AS, as well as for achieving the best possible long-term and safety outcomes for these patients.

AB  - Background: Evidence on association between body composition and outcomes of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is limited for Asian patients. This study investigated the prognostic role of body composition parameters in Taiwanese patients undergoing TAVI. Materials and methods: Data of consecutive patients undergoing TAVI for severe aortic stenosis between May 1, 2010 and August 31, 2019 were prospectively collected in this observational study. The association between body composition parameters (body mass index [BMI], body surface area [BSA], lean body mass [LBM], and LBM index) and cumulative mortality was analyzed using Cox proportional hazard regression model. Results: A total of 221 patients (mean age 81.4 years), including 125 (56.6%) males, were included with median follow-up duration of 23.8 months. In males, multivariate analysis revealed that higher BMI (P = 0.035), BMI ≥ 20 kg/m2 (P = 0.026), and higher LBM index (P = 0.023) significantly predicted lower overall all-cause cumulative mortality. In females, none of the body composition parameters was significantly associated with all-cause cumulative mortality. Paradoxical association between BMI and estimated all-cause cumulative mortality was only significant among male patients. Conclusion: In Taiwanese TAVI patients, the prognostic effects of BMI and LBM index on cumulative mortality were only observed in males, not in females. Sex differences must be considered when stratifying risk among patients undergoing TAVI.

T2  - Anesthesiology Clinics
AB  - Women presenting for cardiac surgery tend to be older and have hypertension, diabetes, and overweight or underweight body mass index than men. Despite improvements in surgical techniques and medications, women have increased risk for morbidity and mortality after multiple types of cardiac surgery. Women presenting for transcatheter aortic valve replacement are older and frailer than men, and have increased risk of intraoperative complications, but lower mortality at mid- and long-term ranges compared with men. Adherence to recovery and rehabilitation from cardiac surgery is challenging for women. Solutions should focus on increased family support, and use of group exercise and activities.

AB  - Background: The epidemiological impact of aortic stenosis has recently grown, and indications to valvular treatment have changed substantially with the implementation in clinical practice of TAVI procedures. Significant differences according to patients' sex are likely to be related to different biological features, but the undelrying mechanisms haven't been verified yet. Aims and Methods: We collected from the SwissTAVI Registry the available data about 373 subjects who where consecutively treated in Cardiocentro Ticino with a TAVI procedure over the last 10 years. We compared two subgroups of female (n = 161, age 83.5±5.4 yrs) and male (n = 212, age 82.3±5.9 yrs) patients in terms of severity indices of the disease (residual valve area and transvalvular gradients). The same parameters were measured after the procedure with a quantitative estimation of eventual post-procedural paravalvular leaks. Results: As previously reported, female patients showed significantly higher transvalvular mean gradients at baseline (48.02±16.0 vs. 42.9±14.8 mmHg; P = 0.004) on smaller resudual valve areas (0.66±0.18 vs. 0.77±0.19 cm2; P <0.001). TAVI procedures were equally efficient in both sex, restoring similar valve areas and gradients, but paravalvular leaks were more frequent and significant in females (F vs. M no leak 44.5 vs. 55.3%, mild 47.7 vs. 42.7%, moderate 6.5 vs. 1.5%, severe 1.3 vs. 0.5%; overall P = 0.037). Conclusions: Sex-related differences are only partially described and their substrate is not clear. Female patients are known to be more prone to bleedings and cerebrovascular accidents, but our data show that also paravalvular leaks could be more common and significant in comparison to males. A detailed analysis of the anatomy of the aortic outflow and of the valvular deterioration in aortic stenosis is required and is the aim of the second phase of this study. Understanding sex-related characteristics underlying these discrepancies can potentially improve TAVI technologies towards a further customization of prosthetic devices.

AB  - Purpose: Poorer short-term outcomes have been described for females after cardiovascular surgery. We examined the influence of sex on the outcomes after aortic root replacement (ARR). Methods: Medical records of 848 patients (females, n = 159/848, 19%) who underwent ARR at our center from 2005 to 2018 were retrospectively reviewed. Sex differences of the following outcomes were analyzed: the primary end point (in-hospital mortality or stro111ke), secondary end point (new requirement for permanent pacemaker), and long-term survival (median follow-up 21.4 months [interquartile range,1.3-60.0]). Results: Females were significantly older (61.3 vs 58.7 [male]) with higher rates of pre-existing cerebrovascular disease (14% [22/159] vs 7% [52/689]) and previous valve intervention (20% [32/159] vs 13% [89/689]) but less myocardial infarction [1%(1/159) vs 7%(48/689)]. The surgical indication was different (aneurysm 75% [120/159] vs 87% [602/689], dissection 13% [21/159] vs 6% [41/689]; P <.01]). Females had larger average aneurysm size after controlling for body size (P ≤.001). There was no sex difference in in-hospital mortality (3% [5/159] vs 2% [16/689]) or stroke (4% [7/159] vs 4% [29/689]). Multivariable logistic regression indicated that female sex was not an independent predictor of combined in-hospital stroke or death (odds ratio [OR], 0.59; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.28-1.25), confirmed by propensity score analysis. There was no difference in long-term survival (5-year survival, 90.96% vs 93.03%; P =.44). Females had higher incidence of permanent pacemaker requirement [11% (18/159) vs 6% (39/689), P =.03] and female sex was an independent predictor of permanent pacemaker requirement (OR, 2.01; 95% CI, 1.085-3.724; P =.03). Conclusions: While female patients have different baseline characteristics and indication for ARR, they are not exposed to an increased risk of in-hospital mortality or stroke. However, females experience increased incidence of permanent pacemaker requirement.

AB  - Background: The respective impacts of transvalvular flow, gradient, sex, and their interactions on mortality in patients with severe aortic stenosis undergoing surgical aortic valve replacement (AVR) are unknown. Objectives: This study sought to compare the impact of pre-operative flow-gradient patterns on mortality after AVR and to examine whether there are sex differences. Methods: This study analyzed clinical, echocardiographic, and outcome data prospectively collected in 1,490 patients (544 women [37%]), with severe aortic stenosis and preserved left ventricular ejection fraction who underwent AVR. Results: In this cohort, 601 patients (40%) had normal flow (NF) with high gradient (HG), 405 (27%) NF with low gradient (LG), 246 (17%) paradoxical low flow (LF)/HG, and 238 (16%) LF/LG. During a median follow-up of 2.42 years (interquartile range: 1.04 to 4.29 years), 167 patients died. Patients with LF/HG exhibited the highest mortality after AVR (hazard ratio [HR]: 2.01; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.33 to 3.03; p < 0.01), which remained significant after multivariate adjustment (HR: 1.96; 95% CI: 1.29 to 2.98; p < 0.01). Both LF/LG and NF/LG patients had comparable outcome to NF/HG (p ≥ 0.47). Optimal thresholds of stroke volume index were obtained for men (40 ml/m2) and women (32 ml/m2). Using these sex-specific cutpoints, paradoxical LF was independently associated with increased mortality in both women (adjusted HR: 2.05; 95% CI: 1.21 to 3.47; p < 0.01) and men (adjusted HR: 1.54; 95% CI: 1.02 to 2.32; p = 0.042), whereas guidelines’ threshold (35 ml/m2) does not. Conclusions: Paradoxical LF/HG was associated with higher mortality following AVR, suggesting that a reduced flow is a marker of disease severity even in patients with HG aortic stenosis. Early surgical AVR (i.e., before gradient attains 40 mm Hg) might be preferable in these patients. Furthermore, the use of sex-specific thresholds (<40 ml/m2 for men and <32 ml/m2 for women) to define low-flow outperforms the guidelines’ threshold of 35 ml/m2 in risk stratification after AVR.

AB  - Pressure overload in patients with aortic stenosis (AS) induces an adverse remodeling of the left ventricle (LV) in a sex-specific manner. We assessed whether a sex-specific miR-29b dysregulation underlies this sex-biased remodeling pattern, as has been described in liver fibrosis. We studied mice with transverse aortic constriction (TAC) and patients with AS. miR-29b was determined in the LV (mice, patients) and plasma (patients). Expression of remodeling-related markers and histological fibrosis were determined in mouse LV. Echocardiographic morphofunctional parameters were evaluated at baseline and post-TAC in mice, and preoperatively and 1 year after aortic valve replacement (AVR) in patients with AS. In mice, miR-29b LV regulation was opposite in TAC-males (down-regulation) and TAC-females (up-regulation). The subsequent changes in miR-29b targets (collagens and GSK-3β) revealed a remodeling pattern that was more fibrotic in males but more hypertrophic in females. Both systolic and diastolic cardiac functions deteriorated more in TAC-females, thus suggesting a detrimental role of miR-29b in females, but was protective in the LV under pressure overload in males. Clinically, miR-29b in controls and patients with AS reproduced most of the sexually dimorphic features observed in mice. In women with AS, the preoperative plasma expression of miR-29b paralleled the severity of hypertrophy and was a significant negative predictor of reverse remodeling after AVR; therefore, it may have potential value as a prognostic biomarker.

AB  - Objective: To assess gene expression in cardiomyocytes isolated from patients with aortic stenosis, hypothesizing that maladaptive remodeling and inflammation-related genes are higher in male vs female patients. Patients and Methods: In this study, 34 patients with aortic stenosis undergoing aortic valve replacement from March 20, 2016, through May 24, 2017, at the German Heart Centre in Berlin, Germany, were included. Isolated cardiomyocytes from interventricular septum samples were used for gene expression analysis. Clinical and echocardiographic data were collected preoperatively. Results: Age, body mass index, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, comorbidities, and medication were similar between the 17 male and 17 female patients. The mean ± SD left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (52±9 vs 45±4 mm; P=.007) and posterior wall thickness (14.2±2.5 vs 12.1±1.6 mm; P=.03) were higher in male vs female patients, while ejection fraction was lower in male patients (49%±14% vs 59%±5%; P=.01). Focusing on structural genes involved in the development of cardiac hypertrophy and remodeling, we found that most were expressed higher in male vs female patients. Our modeling analysis revealed that 2 inflammation-related genes, CCN2 and NFKB1, were negatively related to ejection fraction, with this effect being male specific (P=.03 and P=.02, respectively). Conclusion: These findings provide novel insight into cardiomyocyte-specific molecular changes related to sex differences in pressure overload and a significant male-specific association between cardiac function and inflammation-related genes. Considering these sex differences may contribute toward a more accurate design of research and the development of more appropriate therapeutic approaches for both male and female patients.

AB  - Aims: Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in aortic stenosis (AS) varies widely before and after aortic valve replacement (AVR), and deeper phenotyping beyond traditional global measures may improve risk stratification. We hypothesized that machine learning derived 3D LV models may provide a more sensitive assessment of remodelling and sex-related differences in AS than conventional measurements. Methods and results: One hundred and sixteen patients with severe, symptomatic AS (54% male, 70 ± 10 years) underwent cardiovascular magnetic resonance pre-AVR and 1 year post-AVR. Computational analysis produced co-registered 3D models of wall thickness, which were compared with 40 propensity-matched healthy controls. Preoperative regional wall thickness and post-operative percentage wall thickness regression were analysed, stratified by sex. AS hypertrophy and regression post-AVR was non-uniform-greatest in the septum with more pronounced changes in males than females (wall thickness regression:-13 ± 3.6 vs.-6 ± 1.9%, respectively, P < 0.05). Even patients without LVH (16% with normal indexed LV mass, 79% female) had greater septal and inferior wall thickness compared with controls (8.8 ± 1.6 vs. 6.6 ± 1.2 mm, P < 0.05), which regressed post-AVR. These differences were not detectable by global measures of remodelling. Changes to clinical parameters post-AVR were also greater in males: N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) [-37 (interquartile range-88 to-2) vs.-1 (-24 to 11) ng/L, P = 0.008], and systolic blood pressure (12.9 ± 23 vs. 2.1 ± 17 mmHg, P = 0.009), with changes in NT-proBNP correlating with percentage LV mass regression in males only (ß 0.32, P = 0.02). Conclusion: In patients with severe AS, including those without overt LVH, LV remodelling is most plastic in the septum, and greater in males, both pre-AVR and post-AVR. Three-dimensional machine learning is more sensitive than conventional analysis to these changes, potentially enhancing risk stratification.

T2  - Journal of the Hong Kong College of Cardiology
AB  - Objectives: This study sought to examine short-term outcomes with transcatheter mitraclip in women versus men. Background: MitraClip is now approved for severe functional mitral regurgitation in high-risk patients with contraindications to surgical mitral valve repair. Previous studies have shown conflicting results with respect to sex differences in outcomes with the MitraClip. Methods: Electronic search was performed until April 2020 for studies reporting outcomes with MitraClip in women versus men. Random effects DerSimonian-Laird odds ratios were calculated. Outcomes included all-cause mortality and major cardiovascular events at short-term follow-up (in hospital or 30 days) as well as complications. Results: Six studies (4 MitraClip registries; 2344 patients; 925 women) were analyzed. Women were older but exhibited fewer comorbidities. At 30 days, men had more stroke (p<0.0347) and major vascular complications (p<0.042), without a difference in all-cause and cardiovascular mortality (OR 1.31, 0.67-2.57, p<0.43) compared with men. There was no difference in pericardial effusion/cardiac tamponade (p<0.311) or acute renal failure (p<0.805). However, for 4 of the studies, female sex was associated with lower all-cause mortality at 1 year (p=0.01), potentially caused by less moderate/severe aortic insufficiency (p=0.001), and lower cardiovascular mortality (p=0.009). The female survival advantage remained consistent across multiple secondary analyses. The risk of stroke, moderate/severe aortic insufficiency, and all-cause mortality seemed to vary based on the type of valve used; however, without significant subgroup interactions. Conclusions: Despite conflicting data, women experience better short-term outcomes with the MitraClip repair.

AB  - Background It is unclear if gender influences aortic regurgitation (AR) related chamber or tissue remodeling. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) accurately determines AR severity and fibrosis burden. We utilized CMR to study gender differences in left ventricular (LV) remodeling to AR. Methods We enrolled patients with isolated AR between 2011-2019 and excluded those with confounding causes of LV remodeling. We performed blinded assessment of LV volume, mass, regurgitant volume, and interstitial fibrosis by extracellular volume fraction (ECV), which quantifies the cellular and extracellular myocardial compartments. Results We studied 240 patients (93 women) with mean age 56.5±16 years. Bicuspid aortic valve was more common in men (44.9 vs. 26.9%, P<0.001). Across tertiles of regurgitant volume, women had smaller LV end diastolic volume, end systolic volume, and LV mass than men (All P<0.05). Indexed LV volumes were similar between men and women in moderate or greater AR (P≥0.2). Women had higher ECV than men with increasing AR severity (P for interaction=0.02), but ECV was similar across degrees of AR severity in men. Conclusion Women have smaller LV volume and mass than men across similar degrees of AR. However, women have increased burden of interstitial fibrosis with increasing AR severity, driven by expansion of the extracellular volume in relation to the cellular volume. Further research is needed to determine if separate gender-based thresholds for timing of surgery are warranted.

AB  - Background Gender-related differences are known about pathophysiology and clinical outcome of aortic stenosis (AS). Nevertheless, the impact due to gender on effort intolerance as well as its mechanisms has not been defined. We sought to assess functional capacity in AS labelling gender differences. Methods Sixty patients [age 69(63-76)years; female 24(40%)] with at least moderate AS (rest Vmax >3 m/s) underwent to rest and exercise echocardiography with simultaneous cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) during maximal symptom-limited exercise. Differences on echocardiographic and CPET variables were assessed according to gender. Results Women showed lower effort tolerance [female vs male: workload 51(46.5-72.5) vs 92.5(74-118.5)watts, p<.0001; peakVO2 13.2(12-15.2) vs 17.7(14.2-22-7)mL/kg/min, p=.002; Predicted peakVO2 63.5(53.5-74) vs 76(61.5-101)%, p=.006; anaerobic threshold 11.4(9.8-13.2) vs 12.8(11.4-15-7)mL/kg/min, p=.01; VE/VCO2 29.5(26.1-30.2) vs 26.2(24.3-28.5), p=.008] characterized by lower chronotropic reserve [age-predicted heart rate (HR) reserve 69.5(58.6-78.9) vs 82.8(74.6-89.7)%, p=.003; HR reserve 40.5(33.6-51) vs 47.5(39-67.5), p=.02; HR recovery at 1 min 9(4-12) vs 14(8.5-20), p=.002)], lower cardiac output (CO) response [exercise CO 7.9(6.4-8.8) vs 8.6(7.9-9.9) L/min, p=.01; CO reserve 2.9(2.1-3.6) vs 4.3(3.2-5.4)L, p=.0008] and lower peripheral extraction [C(A-V)VO2 12(9.7-14.2) vs 15.4(13.8-16.6)mL/100mL, p=.0007]. At 12 months follow up, the incidence for AVR was 0.55(0.31-0.73) in women and 0.29(0.15-0.45) in men, while at 60 months it was respectively 0.69(0.44-0.85) and 0.59(0.11-0.35). Conclusion In women, moderate-to-severe AS generates a higher degree of functional limitation compared to men. A lower CO reserve, mainly determined by an impaired chronotropic response and lower C(A-V)O2, plays a central role. This unfavourable phenotype is associated with a less advanced LV remodelling pattern and an earlier incidence of AVR.

AB  - Background Several studies have shown an association between aortic valve stenosis (AS) and atherosclerosis. This study aimed at evaluating the sex differences in aortic valve calcification (AVC) and coronary artery calcification (CAC) in patients prior to transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Methods 260 patients (80±7 years old, 39% male) with severe AS, scheduled for TAVR, were included. Patients with cardiovascular intervention or aortic valve replacement prior to cardiac computed tomography (CT) were excluded. AVC and CAC were assessed by noncontrast cardiac CT. We used the standard reference values of CAC score to classify the percentile groups, in order to determine the distribution of AVC and CAC. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality. Results In men the AVC score was 3910HU (IQR 2524-5258) and in women 2408HU (IQR 1588-3359) (p<0.001). The CAC score in men was 824HU (IQR 327-1854) and in women 477HU (IQR 136-962) (p<0.001). Men and women had the same pattern of CAC distribution. In contrast to women, in men the AVC distribution increased per percentile group (Figure 1a). During a median follow-up of 1095 days, 59 (23%) patients died. There was no significant sex-difference in mortality rate for CAC (p=0.187, Figure 1b). Conclusion Men with severe AS show higher AVC and CAC scores than women. In men and women the pattern of CAC distribution is the same, however the pattern of AVC distribution is different. There is no higher mortality rate for CAC comparing men and women. [Figure presented]

AB  - For years, calcific aortic stenosis (AS) was considered to be similar in men and women, and the underrepresentation of women in research studies prevented any alternate conclusions. With new sex-specific studies and data, the landscape of AS is evolving and recently important sex-disparities were revealed. These sex-specific discrepancies are of utmost importance to stratify and personalize treatment according to sex. It is important and urgent to elucidate the sex-related differences and similarities in the pathophysiology of AS to develop and validate sex-specific approaches for the management and pharmacologic treatment of AS, and to improve clinical outcomes for both sexes.

AB  - The development of new devices and treatment options has greatly increased the interest in heart valve diseases. In this context, the consideration of gender differences in diagnosis, treatment success, and prognosis is of great importance. Available data show that women and men with heart valve disease have different risk profiles, which have a significant impact on treatment outcomes and prognosis. It is the purpose of this review article to give an overview of gender-related differences in patients with valvular heart disease, regarding clinical presentation, treatment, and outcomes. In light of the emerging treatment possibilities, future research should emphasize the role of gender since both sexes benefit from tailored management.

T2  - Expert Review of Cardiovascular Therapy
AB  - Introduction: In aortic stenosis (AS), there are clear sex differences in clinical presentation, left ventricular (LV) response to pressure overload, and pathophysiology of valvular calcification. These differences may affect outcome following valve intervention. Area covered: This review aims to discuss sex differences in clinical presentation, pathophysiology of aortic valve calcification, LV remodeling in view of historic and recent echocardiographic and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging studies, and outcome after valve intervention. In addition, it will also provide some brief insights on the exercise physiology in women and men with AS. Expert commentary: Women at presentation are often older, have higher prevalence of hypertension and diastolic dysfunction, while men are younger, and more often have a bicuspid aortic valve and higher atherosclerotic disease burden. Men have more valve calcification than women for a given severity of AS and develop different patterns of LV remodeling and myocardial fibrosis. Although women tend to walk shorter on treadmill and achieve lower metabolic equivalents, they achieve similar peak heart rates and blood pressure, and the frequency of revealed symptoms during exercise test is comparable in both sexes. Men are more likely to undergo a surgical AVR with better outcome, while women have generally better outcome after TAVI.

AB  - Transcriptional studies of the human heart provide insight into physiological and pathophysiological mechanisms, essential for understanding the fundamental mechanisms of normal cardiac function and how they are altered by disease. To improve the understanding of why men and women may respond differently to the same therapeutic treatment it is crucial to learn more about sex-specific transcriptional differences. In this study the transcriptome of right atrium and left ventricle was compared across sex and regional location. Paired biopsies from five male and five female patients undergoing aortic valve replacement or coronary artery bypass grafting were included. Gene expression analysis identified 620 differentially expressed transcripts in atrial and ventricular tissue in men and 471 differentially expressed transcripts in women. In total 339 of these transcripts overlapped across sex but notably, 281 were unique in the male tissue and 162 in the female tissue, displaying marked sex differences in the transcriptional machinery. The transcriptional activity was significantly higher in atrias than in ventricles as 70% of the differentially expressed genes were upregulated in the atrial tissue. Furthermore, pathway-and functional annotation analyses performed on the differentially expressed genes showed enrichment for a more heterogeneous composition of biological processes in atrial compared with the ventricular tissue, and a dominance of differentially expressed genes associated with infection disease was observed. The results reported here provide increased insights about transcriptional differences between the cardiac atrium and ventricle but also reveal transcriptional differences in the human heart that can be attributed to sex.

AB  - Purpose: Cardiovascular mortality remains high among patients with diabetes compared with the general population. The primary aim was to evaluate the interest in and demand for advanced cardiovascular screening in patients with diabetes; the secondary aim was to explore its efficiency in detecting unprotected subclinical cardiovascular disease (CVD). Patients and Methods: In a cross-sectional design, randomly selected 40–60-year-old men and women with diabetes were invited to the screening trial. Screening encompassed (1) a comprehensive medical interview; (2) non-contrast computed tomography scanning to quantify coronary artery and aortic valve calcification, to measure left atrial size, to assess heart rhythm and to detect aortic and iliac dilatations; (3) ankle and brachial blood pressure measurements; and (4) blood and urine samples for measurements of HbA1c, lipid profile, renal function, NT-pro B-type natriuretic peptide (pro-BNP) and albuminuria. Primary outcome was participation rate; secondary outcome was rate of unprotected subclinical CVD. Results: Of 465 invited patients, 191 (41.1%) attended screening. The participation rate was 40% (95% CI:33–47) for males and 42% (95% CI:36–48) for females. Twenty-four patients were excluded due to previous CVD. The remaining patients’ mean age was 52 years; 58% were males. Subclinical CVD was found in 64%, with a male preponderance (males 75% (95% CI:66–83; females 49% (95% CI:37–60)). Presence of severe coronary artery calcification (score ≥ 400) showed a male preponderance (males 19% (95% CI:12–27); females 7% (95% CI:3–16)). Aortic valve calcification, enlarged left atrial volume, atrial fibrillation, aortic dilatations, peripheral artery disease or increased pro-BNP were uncommon, and without any sex differences. Unprotected subclinical CVD was very common, and medical treatment was intensified in 60% (95% CI:53–68) of patients. Conclusion: We propose a feasible cardiovascular screening examination from which middle-aged patients with diabetes may benefit. However, the participation rate may be too low to warrant screening.

AB  - Summary Left ventricular (LV) remodeling with aortic stenosis (AS) appears to differ according to sex, but reverse remodeling after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has not been elucidated in a Japanese popula-tion. This study aims to determine whether any sex-related differences in LV or reverse remodeling after TAVI exist in the context of severe AS. Of 208 patients who received TAVI for severe AS in our institution, 100 (men, 42; mean age, 83.0 ± 4.9 years) underwent transthoracic echocardiography before and 3 months after TAVI. Despite similar valvular gra-dients, women with severe AS had lower indexed LV mass (LVMi) than did men (152.3 ± 35.4 versus 173.2 ± 44.6 g/m2, P = 0.005), with smaller indexed LV end-diastolic (LVEDVi) (50.2 ± 13.3 versus 61.4 ± 20.7 mL/ m2, P = 0.001) and end-systolic (LVESVi; 17.9 ± 8.7 versus 24.3 ± 13.8 mL/m2, P = 0.006) volumes. After TAVI, women (−6.0% ± 14.4%) had higher reduction in the rate of change of relative wall thickness (RWT) than did men (4.4% ± 19.0%, P = 0.003). Men (−8.9% ± 3.9%) had higher reduction in the rate of change of LVEDVi than did women (1.5% ± 3.3%, P = 0.045). Incidence of LV reverse remodeling defined as a reduction in LVESV of >15% was significantly higher in men (50%) than in women (26%, P = 0.013). In addition to sex differences in the pattern of LV remodeling with AS, reverse LV remodeling after TAVI also differed between sexes.

AB  - Aortic stenosis (AS) is common and increasing in prevalence as the population ages. Using computed tomography (CT) to quantify aortic valve calcification (AVC) it has been reported that men have greater degrees of calcification than women among subjects with severe AS. These data, however, were derived in largely Caucasian populations and have not been verified in non-Caucasian subjects. This retrospective study identified 137 patients with severe AS who underwent valve replacement and had CT scans within 6 months prior to surgery. AVC scores were compared between men and women, both in the entire sample and in racial subgroups. 52% of subjects were male and 62.8% were non-Caucasian. Mean AVC score for the entire cohort was 3062.08 2097.87 with a range of 428-13,089. Gender differences in aortic valve calcification were found to be statistically significant with an average AVC score of 3646 2422 in men and 2433 1453 in women (p=0.001). On multivariate analysis, gender remained significantly associated with AVC score both in the entire sample (p=0.014) and in the non-Caucasian subgroup (p=0.008). Mean AVA was significantly greater in males than females but this difference disappeared when AVA was indexed to BSA (p=0.719). AVA was not different between racial groups (p=0.369). In this research we observed that among subjects with severe AS men have higher AVC scores than women regardless of racial background. This is consistent with previous studies in predominantly Caucasian populations.

AB  - Background: Gender-related differences are known about pathophysiology and clinical outcome of aortic stenosis (AS). Nevertheless, the impact due to gender on effort intolerance as well as its mechanisms has not been defined. We sought to assess functional capacity in AS labelling gender differences. Methods: Sixty patients [age 69(63-76)years; female 24(40%)] with at least moderate AS (rest Vmax >3 m/s) underwent to rest and exercise echocardiography with simultaneous cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) during maximal symptom-limited exercise. Differences on echocardiographic and CPET variables were assessed according to gender. Results: Women showed lower effort tolerance [female vs male: workload 51(46.5-72.5) vs 92.5(74-118.5)watts, p<.0001; peakVO2 13.2(12-15.2) vs 17.7(14.2-22-7)mL/kg/min, p=.002; Predicted peakVO2 63.5(53.5-74) vs 76(61.5-101)%, p=.006; anaerobic threshold 11.4(9.8-13.2) vs 12.8(11.4-15-7)mL/kg/min, p=.01; VE/VCO2 29.5(26.1-30.2) vs 26.2(24.3-28.5), p=.008] characterized by lower chronotropic reserve [age-predicted heart rate (HR) reserve 69.5(58.6-78.9) vs 82.8(74.6-89.7)%, p=.003; HR reserve 40.5(33.6-51) vs 47.5(39-67.5), p=.02; HR recovery at 1 min 9(4-12) vs 14(8.5-20), p=.002)], lower cardiac output (CO) response [exercise CO 7.9(6.4-8.8) vs 8.6(7.9-9.9) L/ min, p=.01; CO reserve 2.9(2.1-3.6) vs 4.3(3.2-5.4)L, p=.0008] and lower peripheral extraction [C(A-V)VO2 12(9.7-14.2) vs 15.4(13.8-16.6)mL/100mL, p=.0007]. At 12 months follow up, the incidence for AVR was 0.55(0.31-0.73) in women and 0.29(0.15-0.45) in men, while at 60 months it was respectively 0.69(0.44-0.85) and 0.59(0.11-0.35). Conclusions: in women, moderate-to-severe AS generates a higher degree of functional limitation compared to men. A lower CO reserve, mainly determined by an impaired chronotropic response and lower C(A-V)O2, plays a central role. This unfavourable phenotype is associated with a less advanced LV remodelling pattern and an earlier incidence of AVR.

AB  - BACKGROUND Despite the establishment of multiple factors influencing short-and long term outcomes in patients treated with TAVI, the real world data on the association between gender and outcomes after TAVI remain conflicting. AIMS The aim of this analysis was to evaluate the association of gender with the clinical and periprocedural characteristics along with in hospital, short-and medium term outcomes of patients treated with TAVI in the tertiary Polish centre in more than a decade. METHODS AND RESULTS Out of 451 consecutive patients who underwent TAVI at our centre between 2006 and 2019, the detailed characteristics were available in 275. Women were significantly older (median age, 80 years; IQR, 74-84) than men (median, 77 years; IQR, 72-82). There were no significant differences in the prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors, apart from median LVEF, which was significantly lower in men (46%) than in women (52%, P <0.001). Almost one in two male patients underwent CABG before TAVI (49.3% vs 18.6% women, P <0.001). The median logistic Euroscore was 23.3% and did not differ between men (median 24%) and women (median, 22.1%; P = 0.67). In women, the surgical cutdown was performed significantly more frequently than in men (38.7% vs 23.1%; P = 0.03) but no significant differences in the vascular closure techniques were observed (P = 0.11). In female patients, the Boston Acurate and Edwards Sapien valves were more frequently implanted (respectively 35.6% and 19.8% in women vs 25.2% and 11.2% in men), while in men, Medtronic Corevalve was more frequently chosen (63.6% in men vs 44.7% in women; P = 0.006). The implantation was successful in 95% of women and 98.5% of men (P = 0.13). During the index hospitalization, men significantly more frequently required implantation of a pacemaker than women (20.0% vs 10.4%; P = 0.03). There were no differences in the rate of periprocedural vascular complications between the groups, with exception of severe bleeding (in 16.2% of women vs 7.2% of men; P = 0.03) and the necessity for blood transfusion (55.3% in women vs 35.4% in men; P = 0.002). No differences were observed in the duration of hospitalization (overall median, 7 days; IQR, 5-13; P = 0.21) and moderate to severe paravalvular leak after TAVI (9.7% in men vs 6.0% in women; P = 0.35). There were no significant differences in 30 day all cause mortality (3% in women vs 1.4% in men; P = 0.43). No significant differences in the all cause mortality in 6 month (10.5% in men and 11.9% in women; P = 0.44) and in 12 month follow up (12.4% in men vs 13.1% in women; P = 0.51) were observed. CONCLUSIONS Despite advanced age and high prevalence of CV risk factors, the overall short-and medium term prognosis in patients treated with TAVI in our analysis of the real world population remains relatively low. Although men seemed to have a slightly worse clinical baseline profile, their 30 day, 6 month and 12 month outcomes did not differ significantly than in female patients.

AB  - Background: Transfemoral aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is a guideline-recommended treatment option for patients with severe aortic valve stenosis. Women and men present with different baseline characteristics, which may influence procedural outcomes. Objectives: This study sought to evaluate differences between women and men undergoing transfemoral TAVR across the globe during the last decade. Methods: The CENTER (Cerebrovascular EveNts in patients undergoing TranscathetER aortic valve implantation with balloon-expandable valves versus self-expandable valves)-collaboration was a global patient level dataset of patients undergoing transfemoral TAVR (N = 12,381) from 2007 to 2018. In this retrospective analysis, the study examined differences in baseline patient characteristics, 30-day stroke and mortality, and in-hospital outcomes between female and male patients. The study also assessed for temporal changes in outcomes and predictors for mortality per sex. Results: We included 58% (n = 7,120) female and 42% (n = 5,261) male patients. Women had higher prevalence of hypertension and glomerular filtration rate <30 ml/min/1.73 m2 but lower prevalence of all other traditional cardiovascular comorbidities. Both sexes had similar rates of 30-day stroke (2.3% vs. 2.5%; p = 0.53) and mortality (5.9% vs. 5.5%; p = 0.17). In contrast, women had a 50% higher risk of life-threatening or major bleeding (6.7% vs. 4.4%; p < 0.01). Over the study period, mortality rates decreased to a greater extent in men than in women (60% vs. 50% reduction; both p < 0.001), with no reductions in stroke rates over time. Conclusions: In this global collaboration, women and men had similar rates of 30-day mortality and stroke. However, women had higher rates of procedural life-threatening or major bleeding after TAVR. Between 2007 and 2018, mortality rates decreased to a greater extent in men than in women.

AB  - Introduction: Little is known about ethnic and gender disparities for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) procedures in the United States. Methods: We queried the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) database (2011–2014) to identify patients who underwent TAVR. We described the temporal trends in the uptake of TAVR procedures among various ethnicities and genders. Results: Our analysis identified 39,253 records; 20,497 (52.2%) were men and 18,756 (47.8%) were women. Among all TAVRs, 87.2% were Caucasians, 3.9% were African Americans (AA), 3.7% were Hispanics, and 5.2% were of other ethnicities. We found a significant rise in the trend of TAVRs in all groups: in Caucasian men (coefficient = 0.946, p < 0.001), Caucasian women (coefficient = 0.985, p < 0.001), AA men (coefficient = 0.940, p < 0.001), AA women (coefficient = 0.864, p < 0.001), Hispanic men (coefficient = 0.812, p = 0.001), Hispanic women (coefficient = 0.845, p < 0.001). Hence, the uptrend was most significant among Caucasian women, and relatively least significant among Hispanic men. Multivariate regression analysis was conducted to evaluate in-hospital mortality among different groups after adjusting for demographics and baseline characteristics. After multivariable regression for baseline characteristics overall, the in-hospital mortality per 100 TAVRs was highest among Hispanic men 5.5%, followed by Caucasian women 5.0%, Hispanic women 4.6%, AA women 3.7%, AA men 3.4%, and Caucasian men 3.38% (adjusted p value = 0.004). Conclusions: In this observational study, we demonstrated that there is evidence of ethnic and gender differences in the overall uptake and adjusted mortality of TAVRs in the United States.

AB  - Stroke is a devastating outcome of atherosclerotic carotid occlusive disease. As the second leading global cause of death and long-term disability, prevention of stroke is critical for the improvement of stroke-related mortality and morbidity. Sex differences are increasingly recognized in medicine. Women have a higher prevalence of stroke than men. This review summarizes published literature pertaining to differences in outcomes of revascularization procedures among women and men. Early evidence suggested no sex-specific differences for carotid endarterectomy (CEA) or carotid artery stenting (CAS) performed for carotid stenosis. More recent evidence indicates that there may be an increased risk of periprocedural stroke for women following either forms of revascularization. Some reports suggest an increased risk of stroke with CAS compared to CEA for women. Other registry reports argue against this conclusion and suggest that there is no sex-specific difference for CAS outcomes. All published studies presenting Level 1 data for periprocedural stroke and death after CEA and/or CAS are under-represented with respect to women and therefore do not provide reliable sex-specific information on stroke or death. Women appear to fare worse than men for both CAS and CEA. However, the reason for this is not defined and merits further investigation. Till then, carotid revascularization in appropriately selected men and women remains the mainstay for stroke-prevention. More studies containing enough women to generate the requisite statistical power are required.

AB  - Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has emerged as an alternative treatment for severe symptomatic aortic stenosis in patients who are not suitable for surgery or are at high surgical risk. Approximately 50% of patients undergoing TAVI are female and this is reflected by a higher inclusion rate of women in TAVI trials. However, women undergoing TAVI have different baseline clinical characteristics in comparison to men, with fewer comorbidities and a more preserved left ventricular ejection fraction. This translates into favourable outcomes after TAVI, despite a higher rate of peri-procedural complications. This article discusses gender differences in terms of presentation, procedural characteristics and post-procedural results in patients with aortic stenosis undergoing TAVI, with particular focus on possible sex-specific factors affecting outcome.

AB  - Objectives To investigate sex differences in left ventricular remodelling and outcome in patients undergoing surgical or transcatheter aortic valve replacement (SAVR/TAVR). Methods In this multicentre, observational, outcome study with imaging core-lab analysis, patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) listed for intervention at one of six UK centres were prospectively recruited and underwent cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality and secondary endpoint was cardiovascular mortality. Results 674 patients (425 men, 249 women, age 75±14 years) were included: 399 SAVR, 275 TAVR. Women were older, had higher surgical risk scores and underwent TAVR more frequently (53% vs 33.6%, p<0.001). More men had bicuspid aortic valves (BAVs) (26.7% vs 14.9%, p<0.001) and demonstrated more advanced remodelling than women. During a median follow-up of 3.6 years, 145 (21.5%) patients died, with no significant sex difference in all-cause mortality (23.3% vs 20.5%, p=0.114), but higher cardiovascular mortality in women (13.7% vs 8.5%, p=0.012). There were no significant sex-related differences in outcome in the SAVR or TAVR subgroups, or after excluding those with BAV. Factors independently associated with all-cause mortality were age, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), BAV (better) and myocardial fibrosis detected with late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) in men, and age, LVEF and LGE in women. Age and LGE were independently associated with cardiovascular mortality in both sexes. Conclusions Men demonstrate more advanced remodelling in response to a similar severity of AS. The higher cardiovascular mortality observed in women following AVR is accounted for by women having less BAV and higher risk scores resulting in more TAVR. LGE is associated with a worse prognosis in both sexes.

AB  - Background. Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is the most common congenital heart disease, affecting 0.5%-2% of the general population. It is associated with valvular risk (aortic stenosis and/or regurgitation, endocarditis) but also with aortopathy with a wide spectrum of unpredictable clinical presentations, including aneurysmal dilation of the aortic root and/or ascending aorta, isthmic coarctation, aortic dissection, or wall rupture. Methods. The REgistro della Valvola Aortica Bicuspide della Società Italiana di ECocardiografia e CArdiovascular Imaging is a retrospective (from January 1, 2010)/prospective, multicenter, observational registry, with definitive diagnosis of BAV made by transthoracic (TTE) and/or transesophageal echocardiography, computed tomography, cardiovascular magnetic resonance, or at surgery. Anamnestic, demographic, clinical, and instrumental data are collected into dedicated software at first evaluation and during follow-up. Aortic ectasia is defined for diameters >40 mm for the root, while values >37 mm defined ectasia for ascending aorta. Results. At May 2018, 442 patients with BAV (Male, 70%; M:F ratio 2.3; Mean Age at diagnosis 48 +/-20 years) have been included in the registry. Prevalence of hypertension was 27%, diabetes mellitus 3%, smokinghabit 13%. We reported a majority (43%, 193) of patients of type 1, followed by type 2 (8%, 35) and type 3 (3%, 11). We did not report type 3 without raphe subjects. In 3% (15) of cases, valve phenotype was not assessable at TTE. No gender differences were observed according to BAV phenotypes or calcifications, while male gender was associated to an higher prevalence of aortic valve regurgitation (p=0.0002). There is an higher prevalence of aortopathy in patients with raphe compared with those without raphe (63.7% vs 36.3%; p= 0.012). Conclusion. Preliminary data from Italian Multicenter REBECCA registry underline the high risk of aortopathy in BAV patients with raphe.

AB  - Background: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is a guideline recommended treatment for severe aortic valve stenosis, but differences in baseline characteristics can influence sex-based procedural outcomes. The objective of the present study was to evaluate sex differences in a global cohort of patients undergoing transfemoral TAVR in the past decade. Methods: The CENTER collaboration was a global patient-level dataset of patients undergoing transfemoral TAVR (n = 12,381) from 2007 to 2018. We examined sex differences in baseline characteristics, clinical outcomes and temporal trends. Results: The CENTER collaboration included 58% women (n = 7,120) and 42% men (n = 5,261). Women had a higher prevalence of hypertension and glomerular filtration rate <30 ml/min/m2 but a lower prevalence of all other traditional cardiovascular comorbidities. Women and men had similar rates of 30-day stroke (2.3% vs. 2.5%) and mortality (5.2% vs. 5.5%). In contrast, women had a 50% higher risk for life-threatening or major bleeding (6.7% vs. 4.4%; p < 0.01) and a lower risk for permanent pacemaker implantation (12.2% vs. 16.7%). Over the study period mortality rates decreased to a greater extent in men than in women (60% vs. 50% reduction; p < 0.001 for both), with no reductions in stroke rates over time (Figure). [Figure presented] Conclusion: In the CENTER collaboration of >12,000 patients undergoing transfemoral TAVR across multiple global sites, women and men had similar rates of 30-day mortality and stroke after TAVR. However, women had higher rates of procedural life-threatening or major bleeding. Between 2007 and 2018, mortality rates decreased to a greater extent in men than in women. In contrast, stroke rates decreased in neither sex. Categories: STRUCTURAL: Valvular Disease: Aortic

AB  - Background: Little is known about sex-related differences amongst patients with paradoxical low-flow aortic stenosis (PLF AS). Objective: to examine whether there is a difference between women and men regarding the impact on outcomes and threshold of low-flow. Methods and Results: We analyzed the clinical, Doppler-echocardiographic and outcome data prospectively collected in 1490 patients with severe AS and preserved left-ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) who underwent AVR in a large tertiary referral Canadian center. In our cohort, there were 946 (63%) men and 544 (37%) women. Normal flow was present in 1006 (67%) and PLF in 484 (33%) patients. Baseline characteristics according to sex and flow-status are shown in table 1. During a median follow-up of 2.4 [1.04-4.29] years 167 patients died. Overall, patients with PLF had increased 30-day (10 [2.3%] vs 8 [0.9%], p=0.03) and cumulative all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR]=1.60 [95% CI: 1.17-2.18], p < 0.01). PLF remained independently associated to increased mortality after multivariate adjustment for clinical variables, LVEF and mean gradient (HR=1.53 [95% CI: 1.11-2.11], p < 0.01). Altogether, women had higher 30-day mortality than men (2.3% vs 0.8%, p=0.026), but similar cumulative mortality (p=0.39). Using the guidelines threshold of 35 ml/m2, PLF was associated with increased mortality in women (HR=1.95 [95% CI: 1.18-3.22], p < 0.01) but not in men (HR=1.25 [95% CI: 0.79-1.85], p=0.39). Using spline curve analysis, optimal thresholds were obtained for men (40 ml/m2, panel A) and women (32 ml/m2, panel B). Using these sex-specific thresholds, PLF was independently associated with increased mortality in both women (adjusted HR=2.05 [95% CI: 1.21-3.47], p < 0.01) and men (adjusted HR=1.54 [95% CI 1.02-2.32], p=0.042) (panel C) and improved risk stratification in the whole cohort. In univariate analysis, women with PLF had higher overall mortality than men with PLF (HR=1.37 [1.08-.74], p=0.009), but this difference was no longer significant after adjusting for age, surgical risk score and LVEF (HR=1.17 [0.92-1.50], p=0.21). Conclusion: In patients with severe AS and preserved LVEF undergoing AVR, PLF is associated with increased overall mortality using the guidelines SVi cut-point (< 35 ml/m2) in the whole cohort and in women, but not in men. Defining PLF using the sex-specific thresholds of 40 ml/m2 for men and 32 ml/m2 for women predicted mortality in both sex categories. Our results provide support to the utilization of sex-specific thresholds to define low-flow and enhance risk stratification in AS. [Figure presented] [Figure presented]

AB  - The transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) procedure has emerged as a minimally invasive treatment for patients with aortic valve stenosis (AVS). However, alterations in serum factor composition and biological activity after TAVR remain unknown. Here, we quantified the systemic inflammatory effects of the TAVR procedure and hypothesized that alterations in serum factor composition would modulate valve and cardiac fibrosis. Serum samples were obtained from patients with AVS immediately before their TAVR procedure (pre-TAVR) and about 1 month afterward (post-TAVR). Aptamer-based proteomic profiling revealed alterations in post-TAVR serum composition and ontological analysis identified inflammatory macrophage factors implicated in myofibroblast activation and deactivation. Hydrogel biomaterials used as valve matrix mimics demonstrated that post-TAVR serum reduced myofibroblast activation of valvular interstitial cells relative to pre-TAVR serum from the same patient. Transcriptomics and curated network analysis revealed a shift in myofibroblast phenotype from pre-TAVR to post-TAVR and identified p38 MAPK signaling as one pathway involved in pre-TAVR-mediated myofibroblast activation. Post-TAVR serum deactivated valve and cardiac myofibroblasts initially exposed to pre-TAVR serum to a quiescent fibroblast phenotype. Our in vitro deactivation data correlated with patient disease severity measured via echocardiography and multimorbidity scores, and correlations were dependent on hydrogel stiffness. Sex differences in cellular responses to male and female sera were also observed and may corroborate clinical observations regarding sex-specific TAVR outcomes. Together, alterations in serum composition after TAVR may lead to an antifibrotic fibroblast phenotype, which suggests earlier interventions may be beneficial for patients with advanced AVS to prevent further disease progression.

AB  - Background-Little attention has been paid to the importance of sex in the long-term prognosis of patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Methods and Results-We conducted a retrospective cohort study of Ontario residents, aged ≥40 years, who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and/or aortic, mitral, or tricuspid valve surgery between October 1, 2008, and December 31, 2016. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. The mortality rate in each surgical group was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The risk of death was assessed using multivariable Cox proportional hazard models. Sex-specific mortality risk factors were identified using multiplicative interaction terms. A total of 72 824 patients were included in the study (25% women). The median follow-up period was 5 (interquartile range, 3-7) years. The long-term age-standardized mortality rate was lowest in patients who underwent isolated CABG and highest among those who underwent combined CABG/multiple valve surgery. Women had significantly higher age-standardized mortality rate than men after CABG and combined CABG/mitral valve surgery. Men had lower rates of long-term mortality than women after isolated mitral valve repair, whereas women had lower rates of long-term mortality than men after isolated mitral valve replacement. We observed a statistically significant association between female sex and long-term mortality after adjustment for key risk factors. Conclusions-Female sex was associated with long-term mortality after cardiac surgery. Perioperative optimization and long-term follow-up should be tailored to younger women with a history of myocardial infarction and percutaneous coronary intervention and older men with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and depression.

AB  - Gender differences in the outcome of acquired cardiovascular disease are well known, but available literature on the influence of gender in congenital heart disease (CHD) is limited. Registries have provided valuable, albeit at times conflicting data. Higher mortality rates have been reported in older males with CHD, while sudden cardiac death is more prevalent in young males. However, mortality around surgery for CHD is higher in girls compared to boys, likely due to smaller body size. Women are at higher risk of developing pulmonary arterial hypertension, but at lower risk of adverse aortic outcomes, even though they are less likely to receive aortic surgery. Finally, women have a lower risk of presenting with infective endocarditis compared to men. The underlying reasons for gender differences in CHD can be attributed to genetic, hormonal, behavioural and other causes. The aim of the present paper is to provide an overview of available evidence on gender differences in CHD and their impact on outcome.

AB  - Valve-sparing aortic root replacement (VSARR) through reimplantation technique is widely regarded as optimal surgical approach for Marfan syndrome (MFS) patients. Perioperative and long-term data from all MFS patients undergoing VSARR using David's technique at our center from 2007-2018 were analyzed. We included 56 patients with a mean age of 32.3 ± 12.3 years. Logistic EuroSCORE was 7.96 ± 5.2. Among others concomitant surgical procedures included aortic arch surgery (8.9%), mitral valve repair (23.2%) and replacement (1.7%). There were no operative deaths, nor in-hospital-mortality. One patient underwent re-exploration for bleeding, dialysis and pacemaker implantation was required in one case each. There was no occurrence of low-output syndrome nor neurological complications. Significant gender differences were not found, except for intraoperative blood transfusion occurring significantly more often in the female gender (p = 0.009). Despite significantly longer procedural times, concomitant surgery did not negatively impact overall outcome. Freedom of reoperation of the aortic root was 100% at 1 year, 97.7% at 8 years. Until last follow-up (61 ± 38 month) all patients survived, with no evidence of endocarditis. We emphasize once more that VSARR using David's procedure is a safe method for MFS patients with excellent long-term results even if concomitant procedures are performed.

AB  - Background and Aims: Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is three times more prevalent among men than women. However, little is known about gender differences in patients with BAV. We aims to study the gender differences in BAV patients and assessed whether these differences are specific to BAV compared to Tricuspid Aortic Valves (TAV) patients. Methods: This study includes 1140 patients, from ASAP/DAVAACA cohorts which are prospective, single-center, observational cohort studies, with aortic valve disease undergoing elective open-heart surgery. We compared baseline characteristics of BAV in male versus female, using ANOVA or Chi-square tests when appropriate and assocations was determined using generalized linear models. Results: Among the 599 BAV subjects, women (27.7%) were older (mean 63.3(SD 10.5) years versus 59.7(SD 12.9) years in men, p=0.001). Aortic stenosis predominates in BAV women patients (86.1% vs. 70.7% in BAV men patients), and aortic regurgitation in men with BAV (33% vs. 15.1% in women with BAV). Valve morphology doesn't appear to be significantly different across gender (p=0.467) whereas other traits were significantly differently associated between women and men BAV patients. Our results also suggest a genetic link between bicuspidy and gender. All these analyses were also performed in TAV patients and showed characteristics differentially associated compared to BAV patients. Conclusions: We note a significant difference of valve disease between women and men specifically in BAV patients. These findings settle clinical knowledge about gender differences in BAV patients, providing a line to better targeting high cardiovascular risk patients, and represent a substantial step forward the understanding of BAV mechanisms.

AB  - BACKGROUND: we aim to examine trends in the incidence of surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) among women and men in Spain from 2001 to 2015; compare in-hospital outcomes for mechanical and bioprosthetic SAVR by gender and; to identify factors associated with in-hospital mortality (IHM) after SAVR. METHODS: We performed a retrospective study using the Spanish National Hospital Discharge Database, 2001-15. We included patients that had SAVR as procedure in their discharge report. Propensity score matching (PSM) was performed to assess the impact of gender on the outcomes of mechanical and bioprosthetic SAVR. RESULTS: We identified 86 578 patients who underwent SAVR (40% women). Incidence of SVAR was higher in men (incidence rate ratio 1.57; 95%CI 1.55-1.59). In 2001, 73.36% of the men and 71.57% of women received a mechanical prosthesis; these proportions decreased to 43.04% in men and 35.89% in women in 2015, whereas bioprosthetic SAVR increased to 56.96% and 64.11%. After PSM we found that IHM was higher in women than in matched men for mechanical (8.94% vs. 6.79%; P < 0.001) and bioprosthetic (6.51 vs. 5.42%; P = 0.001) SAVR. The mean length of hospital stay was longer (19.54 vs. 18.74 days; P < 0.001) among females than males undergoing mechanical SAVR. Higher IHM after SAVR was associated with older age, comorbidities (except diabetes and atrial fibrillation), concomitant coronary artery bypass graft and emergency room admission. CONCLUSIONS: This nation-wide analysis over 15 years of gender-specific outcomes after SAVR showed that, after PSM women have significantly higher IHM after mechanical and bioprosthetic SAVR than men.

AB  - Heart failure (HF) is a devastating syndrome with poor prognosis that is most often preceded by a left ventricular (LV) pressure overload (PO) disorder, such as aortic stenosis (AS). As pressure inside the LV increases, LV hypertrophy (LVH) develops. Persistent inflammation is known to be detrimental to the heart, which might promote HF. LVH manifests differently between men and women and there are pronounced sex differences in disease progression and outcome. However, the mechanisms that cause these differences are poorly understood. Hypothesizing significant sex differences, we aimed at studying the expression of inflammatory and remodeling genes in cardiomyocytes (CMs) isolated from the LV septum of AS patients (n = 34; 50% men; 67.5 ± 9.6 years old) undergoing aortic valve replacement. Echocardiography was performed 1 week before surgery and 20.06 ± 9.7 days after surgery. Ethics committee approval and patient consent were obtained. There was no significant difference between men and women in age, body mass index, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, co-morbidities and medication. Posterior wall thickness (P = 0.02), LV end diastolic diameter (P = 0.007) and mass index (P = 0.03) were higher in men than women. Preoperative ejection fraction (EF) was significantly lower in men than women (P = 0.01). Postoperative EF levels improved in men reaching those of women. Compared to female CMs, male CMs had significantly higher levels of CTGF (P = 0.03) and NFKB1 (P = 0.01), as well as ACTC1 (P= 0.03), GATA4 (P = 0.03), GJA1 (P = 0.03), MYH6 (P = 0.02), MYL4 (P = 0.03), NPPA (P = 0.03) and NPPB (P = 0.05). We found a negative association between gene expression and postoperative EF in men only for GATA4 (r = -0.77, P = 0.01), GJA1 (r = -0.69, P = 0.03), MYH6 (r = -0.69, P = 0.04), MYH7 (r = -0.82, P = 0.008), MYL4 (r = -0.71, P = 0.03), NPPA (r = -0.9, P = 0.001) and NPPB (r = -0.79, P = 0.01). In endstage HF, the levels of the chemokine receptor CXCR4 were higher (P = 0.04) in LV samples of female (n = 5) vs. male (n = 4) patients. Collectively, in PO and HF, the expression of inflammatory and remodeling genes is regulated in a sex-specific manner, which may contribute to the mechanisms underlying sex differences in disease progression and outcome.

AB  - Gender differences in the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis, cardiovascular risk factors, and diagnosis of coronary artery disease and valvular heart disease are well known. Such differences have also been outlined in the management and outcomes after acute coronary syndromes and valvular repair. Regarding the atherosclerotic process, pathological experimental studies suggest that plaque composition and burden may differ by gender. Female gender is associated with worse outcomes in the case of ischemic heart disease and, compared with men, women are less likely to undergo interventional cardiac procedures and sustain worse outcomes. In the setting of valvular heart disease (VHD), transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) and percutaneous edge-to-edge mitral valve repair are now well-established procedures with high success rates. In women with moderate to severe aortic stenosis, subgroup analyses in TAVI trials have demonstrated gender-related differences suggesting female gender as beneficial in terms of short-, mid-, and long-term outcomes. Similarly, several studies reported different procedural challenges and outcomes in males and females following surgical and percutaneous mitral valve repair. These diverse findings emphasize the necessity to provide gender-specific analyses of interventional methods. This review highlights gender differences in the epidemiology, pathophysiology, treatment options and clinical outcomes of the conditions mentioned above.

AB  - Background: The aim of this study is to analyze sex-specific readmission rates, etiology, and predictors of readmission after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Readmissions after TAVR are common, contributing to increased health care utilization and costs. Many factors have been discovered as predictors of readmission; however, sex-specific disparities in readmission rates are limited. Methods: Between January 2012 and September 2015, adult patients after TAVR were identified using appropriate international classifications of diseases, ninth revision, clinical modification from the National Readmission Database. Incidence of unplanned 30-days readmission rate was the primary outcome of this study. In addition, this study includes sex-specific etiology and predictors of readmissions. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to analyze adjusted readmission rates. Hierarchical 2-level logistic models were used to evaluate predictors of readmission. Results: Readmission rate at 30 days was 17.3%, with slightly higher readmission rates in women (OR 1.09; CI: 1.01–1.19, p < 0.001) after multivariate adjusted analysis. Noncardiac causes were responsible for most readmissions in both genders. Etiologies for readmissions such as arrhythmias, pulmonary complications, and infections were slightly higher in women, whereas heart failure and bleeding complications were higher in men. History of heart failure, atrial fibrillation, prior pacemaker, and renal failure significantly strongly predicted readmissions in both genders. Conclusion: Women undergoing TAVR have slightly higher 30-day all-cause readmission rates. These results indicate that women require more attention compared to men to prevent 30-day readmission. In addition, risk stratification for men and women based on predictors will help identify high-risk men and women for readmissions.

AB  - Background: With the expected growth in the elderly segment of the U.S. population particularly in women, the prevalence of valvular heart disease is bound to increase in the coming years. We sought to delineate the impact of gender on in-hospital clinical outcomes in Medicare-age patients undergoing isolated left-side heart valve surgery. Methods: Using the National Inpatient Sample files from 2003 to 2014, we compared the in-hospital major adverse cardiac and cerebral events (MACCE: all-cause mortality, stroke, or myocardial infarction)and composite complications (MACCE, permanent pacemaker implantation, bleeding requiring transfusion, iatrogenic vascular complications, acute respiratory failure, acute kidney injury requiring hemodialysis, sepsis and prolonged hospital stay)following isolated mitral or aortic surgery between genders with 1:1 propensity score analysis. Further, we examined gender-specific temporal trends of in-hospital clinical outcomes over the study period. Results: There were 336,506 isolated left-side heart valve surgeries over the study period. Following propensity score matching, 24,637 unweighted pairs were identified for gender-specific comparison. Female gender was independently associated with a higher in-hospital MACCE (9.4% vs. 8.3%; OR = 1.14, 95% CI = 1.07–1.21, P < 0.0001)driven mostly by all-cause mortality (5.2% vs. 4.3%; OR = 1.33, 95% CI = 1.12–1.33, P < 0.0001). The composite complication rate (37.9% vs. 35.3%; OR = 1.12, 95% CI-1.08–1.16, P < 0.0001)was also higher in women. Significant reduction in both in-hospital MACCE and all-cause mortality was observed over time regardless of gender. Conclusions: Following isolated left-side heart valve surgery, women experienced higher in-hospital MACCE including all-cause mortality compared to men. Continued temporal improvements in in-hospital clinical outcomes were observed in both genders. Summary for the annotated table of contents: The influence of gender on surgical aortic or mitral valve replacement/repair outcome is unclear. The current study showed that women fared worse than men including all-cause mortality following isolated left-side valve surgery and significant temporal improvements have been made in in-hospital clinical outcomes in both genders during the 12-year study period. Further research in gender-specific approach in management of valve disease is warranted.

AB  - Background: Left ventricular (LV) remodeling and changes in ejection fraction (EF) occur post transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Patients with severe aortic stenosis (sAS) and a baseline LV ejection fraction <60% have been shown to have a worse prognosis post TAVR, compared with those with EF ≥ 60%. Fractional shortening at the midwall (FSmw) provides better understanding of the changes in contractile function than changes in EF when hypertrophic remodeling is present. While women with sAS appear to have higher prevalence of concentric LV remodeling, it is not clear whether there are gender differences in contractile function, as assessed by FSmw, nor how FSmw changes following TAVR. Methods: A total of 436 patients with sAS who underwent TAVR from 2011-2017 were stratified by LVEF <60% and ≥ 60%. They were further stratified according to gender. We compared echo data pre- and 1-year post TAVR: LV mass index (LVMi), relative wall thickness, wall stress (eSS) and FSmw (%). Peak LV pressure was calculated by adding peak transaortic velocity to systolic blood pressure to estimate load. Zva was estimated to understand LV and pulsatile load. Results: A total of 397 patients were included (45.6% women). Overall, TAVR was associated with LV mass regression: LVMi decreased (p<0.05) in both men and women, but there was only a modest change in relative wall thickness. Changes in FSmw were more closely related to changes in wall stress than Zva: FSmw increasing in men (p<0.05) but decreasing in women. Subgroup analysis demonstrated that almost all of the improvement in FSmw occurred in the group with EF<60% at baseline. Conclusion: One-year post TAVR for sAS, both wall stress (cESS) and total ventricular and pulsatile load (Zva) decline. Hypertrophy regresses,but remains concentric in most cases. The overall improvement in contractile function, however, differs significantly by gender, with men showing a dramatic improvement in FSmw, and a reduction in cESS and Zva, but women showing a decrease in FSmw and an increase in cESS. Moreover, the improvement in FSmw in men, and in the group as a whole is driven by the changes in the group with EF<60%. This suggests that this EF value is an important partition value in this population. [Table Presented]

AB  - Sex differences exist in the prevalence, presentation and outcomes of ischemic heart disease (IHD). Females have higher risk of heart failure post-myocardial infarction relative to males and are two to three times more likely to die after coronary artery bypass grafting surgery. We examined sex differences in human myocardial gene expression in response to ischemia. Left ventricular biopsies from 68 male/46 female patients undergoing aortic valve replacement surgery were obtained at baseline and after a median 74 min of cold cardioplegic arrest/ischemia. Transcriptomes were quantified by RNA-sequencing. Cell-type enrichment analysis was used to estimate the identity and relative proportions of different cell types in each sample. A sex-specific response to ischemia was observed for 271 genes. Notably, the expression FAM5C, PLA2G4E and CYP1A1 showed an increased expression in females compared to males due to ischemia and DIO3, MT1G and CMA1 showed a decreased expression in females compared to males due to ischemia. Functional annotation analysis revealed sex-specific modulation of the oxytocin signaling pathway and common pathway of fibrin clot formation. Expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analysis identified variant-by-sex interaction eQTLs, indicative of sex differences in the genotypic effects on gene expression. Cell-type enrichment analysis showed sex-bias in proportion of specific cell types. Common lymphoid progenitor cells and M2 macrophages were found to increase in female samples from pre- to post-ischemia, but no change was observed in male samples. These differences in response to myocardial ischemia provide insight into the sexual dimorphism of IHD and may aid in the development of sex-specific therapies that reduce myocardial injury.

AB  - The impact of gender on management and early outcomes after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) in the setting of newer generation transcatheter heart valves (THVs) is not well known. We evaluated gender-specific differences on clinical management and in-hospital outcomes in adults who underwent TAVI with newer generation THVs. The study population included 298 consecutive patients who underwent TAVI and received a newer generation THV (Sapien 3 [Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, California] or Corevalve Evolut R or Evolut Pro [Medtronic, Minneapolis, Minnesota]) from December 2015 to June 2018 at an academic tertiary medical center. Of the 298 patients, 154 (52%) were men and 144 (48%) were women. Compared with men, women were older, had lower serum creatinine, higher left ventricular ejection fraction, and lower rates of multiple co-morbidities, including previous coronary artery bypass graft surgery, previous myocardial infarction, and atrial fibrillation. Women were noted to have smaller aortic annular area and perimeter and underwent implantation of smaller THVs than men. At the time of discharge, women were more frequently prescribed a P2Y12 inhibitor (primarily clopidogrel) and less frequently prescribed oral anticoagulation (namely warfarin). Hospital length of stay and in-hospital rates of mortality, disabling stroke, and pacemaker were similar in men and women. In conclusion, in this observational prospective study of adults who underwent TAVI with newer generation THVs, while gender-related disparities in clinical presentation and procedural management were observed, no significant difference in clinical outcomes were noted in men and women. Further studies examining gender-related differences in procedural and postprocedural care after TAVI in the contemporary era are warranted to better understand and optimize clinical outcomes in both men and women.

AB  - Objective: This study aimed to examine gender-based differences in epidemiology, clinical characteristics, and management of consecutive patients with heart failure with mid-range ejection fraction (HFmrEF) and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Methods: The APOLLON trial (A comPrehensive, ObservationaL registry of heart faiLure with mid-range and preserved ejection fractiON) is a multicenter, cross-sectional, and observational study. Consecutive patients with HFmrEF or HFpEF who were admitted to the cardiology clinics were included (NCT03026114). Herein, we performed a post-hoc analysis of data from the APOLLON trial. Results: The study population included 1065 (mean age of 67.1±10.6 years, 54% women) patients from 11 sites in Turkey. Compared with men, women were older (68 years vs. 67 years, p<0.001), had higher body mass index (29 kg/m2 vs. 27 kg/m2, p<0.001), and had higher heart rate (80 bpm vs. 77.5 bpm, p<0.001). Women were more likely to have HFpEF (82% vs. 70.9%, p<0.001), and they differ from men having a higher prevalence of hypertension (78.7% vs. 73.2%, p=0.035) and atrial fibrillation (40.7% vs. 29.9%, p<0.001) but lower prevalence of coronary artery disease (29.5% vs. 54.9%, p<0.001). Women had higher N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (691 pg/mL vs. 541 pg/mL, p=0.004), lower hemoglobin (12.7 g/dL vs. 13.8 g/dL, p<0.001), and serum ferritin (51 ng/mL vs. 64 ng/mL, p=0.001) levels, and they had worse diastolic function (E/e’=10 vs. 9, p<0.001). The main cause of heart failure (HF) in women was atrial fibrillation, while it was ischemic heart disease in men. Conclusion: Clinical characteristics, laboratory findings, and etiological factors are significantly different in female and male patients with HFmrEF and HFpEF. This study offers a broad perspective for increased awareness about this patient profile in Turkey. (Anatol J Cardiol 2019; 21: 242-52).

AB  - Little is known about the gender differences of left ventricular (LV) remodeling in patients with aortic valve calcification (AVC). The aim was to assess gender differences of structure functional changes and LV myocardial remodeling in patients with AVC depending on the type of valve lesion. 293 patients (131 men) with revealed AVC by transthoracic echocardioscopy without aortic stenosis and 76 patients (50 men) without AVC were examined. Men had normal geometry of LV more often than women (15.7% vs. 4.4 % in isolated AVC and 11.9% vs. 2.8 % in combined lesion of aortic valve (AV) and mitral valves ring (MVR), р<0.052), and eccentric hypertrophy was registered more often in man with combined AV and MVR lesion (38.1% vs. 15.5 % in women with combined AV and MVR lesion and vs. 20.2 % in men with isolated AVC, р<0.029). LV systolic function was worse in men with combined valves lesion (ejection fraction was 54.0 (48.0; 65.0) vs. 66.0 (60.0; 71.0) % in women with combined valves lesion and vs. 63.0 (55.0; 70.0) % in men with isolated AVC, р<0.022). Men with combined valves lesion also had a larger right ventricle (RV) size (RV index was 1.3 (1.2; 1.5) vs. 1.2 (1.1; 1.4) cm/m2 in women with combined valves lesion and vs. 1.2 (1.1; 1.4) cm/m2 in men with isolated AVC, р<0.036) and had tricuspid regurgitation more often (76.2% vs. 56.3 % in women with combined valves lesion and vs. 58.4 % in men with isolated AVC, р<0.029). Women had higher peak aortic jet velocity (1.5 (1.4; 1.7) vs. 1.4 (1.2; 1.6) m/s in man, р<0.0001). Dominating models of LV remodeling in women were concentric, mainly concentric hypertrophy (61.5% vs. 31.5 % in men in groups with isolated AVC and 64.8% vs. 31.0 % in combined valves lesion groups, р<0.001). Also women had a higher left auricle index than men (2.3 (2.0; 2.5) vs. 2.1 (1.9; 2.4) cm/m2, р<0.015). There were revealed differences in distribution of LV remodeling types depending on the gender and the type of valve lesion.

AB  - Cardiac hypertrophy manifests differently between men and women and there are pronounced sex differences in disease progression and outcome. To better understand remodeling and elucidate underlying mechanisms, most approaches have been limited to animal models or multicellular tissue samples. However, little is known about the role of biological sex in remodeling of human cardiomyocytes. We aimed at studying gene expression in isolated human cardiomyocytes under pressure overload hypothesizing significant sex differences. Cardiomyocytes were isolated from the left ventricular (LV) septum of aortic stenosis patients (n = 34; 50% men; 67.5 ± 9.6 years old) undergoing surgical aortic valve replacement. Patients underwent 2D-guided M-mode transthoracic echocardiography during the week before surgery and 20.06 ± 9.7 days after surgery. We measured with qRT-PCR structural genes, as they are involved in cardiac hypertrophy and remodeling, thereby influencing cardiac function. The study was conducted in conformance with the Basic Principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. There was no significant difference between men and women in age, body mass index, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, co-morbidities and medication. Preoperative posterior wall thickness (P = 0.02), LV end diastolic diameter (P = 0.007) and mass index (P = 0.03) were higher in men than women. At similar levels of aortic valve area index between the sexes, preoperative ejection fraction (EF) was significantly lower in men than women (P = 0.01). Postoperative EF levels improved in men reaching those of women. Male cardiomyocytes had significantly higher levels of ACTC1 (P = 0.03), CTGF (P = 0.03), GATA4 (P = 0.03), GJA1 (P = 0.03), MYH6 (P = 0.02), MYL4 (P = 0.03), NFKB1 (P = 0.01), NPPA (P = 0.03) and NPPB (P = 0.05) than female cardiomyocytes. Next, we asked whether there is an association between gene expression and postoperative EF. The expression of GATA4 (r = -0.77, P = 0.01), GJA1 (r = -0.69, P = 0.03), MYH6 (r = -0.69, P = 0.04), MYH7 (r = -0.82, P = 0.008), MYL4 (r = -0.71, P = 0.03), NPPA (r = -0.9, P = 0.001) and NPPB (r = -0.79, P = 0.01) was negatively correlated with postoperative EF in men only. In conclusion, gene expression is regulated in a sex-specific manner in isolated cardiomyocytes of aortic stenosis patients. Compared with women, men had higher levels of maladaptive remodeling factors, which may be part of the molecular mechanisms underlying the observed sex differences in cardiac function, i.e. EF. Given the male-specific changes in EF postoperatively, cardiomyocyte-specific gene regulation at the time of surgery might inform disease progression.

AB  - Background: Prior studies have shown that a lower proportion of women with severe aortic regurgitation (AR) are referred for surgery for LV dilation and are more likely to be symptomatic. We sought to compare echo and cMRI measurements of LV dimensions and AR severity, and to determine whether there are difference in left ventricular remodeling based on gender. Methods: Patients with at least mild chronic AR who had an echo and cMRI within 90 days were included. Clinical data, echo and cMRI measurements were collected. Severity of AR was determined by regurgitant fraction on cMRI and by echocardiography using ASE guidelines. Results: 240 patients (43 women, age 50 ± 16 years) were included; 135 (56%) with bicuspid and 103 (43%) with tricuspid aortic valves. Severity of AR by echo and cMRI agreed in 47% of cases, with more severe AR by echo more often in women (p<0.001). Severity of AR by cMRI (β=29.4, p<0.001) and female gender (β=-14.9, p=0.009) were independent predictors of LVEDVi. Men had a linear increase in LVEDVi and LVMassi with increasing AR, whereas women had smaller LVEDVi and LVMassi with a steep increase in LVEDVi and LVmassi in the setting of severe AR (Figure). Conclusion: Severity of AR results in significant differences in LV remodeling based on gender. Women have consistently lower LVEDVi and LVMassi than men but demonstrate a sharp increase in both with severe AR. This suggests a need to take gender based remodeling into account to define LV size and volume thresholds for surgical intervention in chronic AR. [Figure presented]

AB  - Background: The gender difference of bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is largely unclear. We evaluate the impact of gender on the morphology, valve function, aortopathy, outcomes of aortic valve replacement (AVR) of BAV patients. Methods: Among 992 BAV patients (mean age 50.3; 734 men; 74.0%) without aortic dissection and congenital heart disease, 658 underwent AVR. The demography, Sievers types, valve function, aortopathy and outcomes of AVR were compared between genders. Results: Sievers types didn't differ between genders. Aortic regurgitation (AR≥2+) (39.0% vs 12.8%, P<0.01), moderate to severe aortic stenosis (m-s AS) with AR≥2+ (14.6% vs 10.9%, P<0.01), isolated aortic root dilatation (3.8% vs 0.8%, P<0.01), and diffuse dilatation (25.3% vs 4.3%, P<0.01) were more common in men, while m-s AS (21.3% vs 45.7%, P<0.01) and isolated ascending dilatation (46.2% vs 61.2%, P<0.01) were more common in women. Men were more prone to developing AR≥2+ (hazard ratio [HR]=4.87, P<0.01), m-s AS with AR≥2+ (HR=2.95, P<0.01), and diffuse aortic dilatation (HR=5.39, P<0.01). Gender didn't predict adverse events after AVR (including mortality, cardiogenic shock, renal failure, re-exploration for bleeding, and stroke; n=90) (HR=1.21; P=0.44); but male gender predicted a left ventricular ejection fraction < 0.5 after AVR (HR=3.07, P=0.03). Conclusion: In this series, two genders didn't differ significantly in valve morphology but had significant differences in valve dysfunction, aortopathy, and outcomes of AVR. [Figure presented]

AB  - Background Chamber size and function analysis can explain cardiac remodeling after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Gender differences of echocardiographic-derived parameters are not well established. We aimed to describe conventional and novel strain-related indices in all 4 cardiac chambers to better understand gender differences in the remodeling process. Methods We retrospectively analyzed patients who underwent TAVR and had baseline (pre) and 1 year post procedural echocardiograms in sinus rhythm. Size and function parameters (volumes and area; ejection fraction (EF), longitudinal strain (LS) and fractional area change) were derived from speckle tracking analyses (TOMTEC) of the 4 cardiac chambers and indexed to body surface area when appropriate. Data were compared between genders. Results 213 consecutive patients were included, 123 were female (58%) and 90 male (42%). At baseline, women had smaller left and right ventricular (LV, RV) size and higher functional parameters (except LV LS). Left and right atrial (LA, RA) size and functional parameters were similar for men and women (except RA longitudinal strain). While overall favorable remodeling in left cardiac chambers was noted (p<0.05 for EF and LS of both LV and LA), remodeling at 1 year was similar in both genders (Table). Conclusion Gender differences on LV and RV size and function exist before TAVR. Favorable remodeling at 1-year occurs similarly in men and women. [Formula presented]

AB  - Background: Contemporary outcomes after surgical management of thoracic aortic disease have improved; however, the impact of sex-related differences is poorly understood. Methods: A total of 1653 patients (498 [30.1%] female) underwent thoracic aortic surgery with hypothermic circulatory arrest between 2002 and 2017 in 10 institutions of the Canadian Thoracic Aortic Collaborative. Outcomes of interest were in-hospital death, stroke, and a modified Society of Thoracic Surgeons-defined composite for mortality or major morbidity (stroke, renal failure, deep sternal wound infection, reoperation, prolonged ventilation). Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine independent predictors of these outcomes. Results: Women were older (mean±SD, 66±13 years versus 61±13 years; P<0.001), with more hypertension and renal failure, but had less coronary disease, less previous cardiac surgery, and higher ejection fraction than men. Rates of aortic dissection were similar between women and men. Rates of hemiarch, and total arch repair were similar between the sexes; however, women underwent less aortic root reconstruction including aortic root replacement, Ross, or valve-sparing root operations (29% versus 45%; P<0.001). Men experienced longer cross-clamp and cardiopulmonary bypass times, but similar durations of circulatory arrest, methods of cerebral perfusion, and nadir temperatures. Women experienced a higher rate of mortality (11% versus 7.4%; P=0.02), stroke (8.8% versus 5.5%; P=0.01), and Society of Thoracic Surgeons-defined composite end point for mortality or major morbidity (31% versus 27%; P=0.04). On multivariable analyses, female sex was an independent predictor of mortality (odds ratio, 1.81; P<0.001), stroke (odds ratio, 1.90; P<0.001), and Society of Thoracic Surgeons-defined composite end point for mortality or major morbidity (odds ratio, 1.40; P<0.001). Conclusions: Women experience worse outcomes after thoracic aortic surgery with hypothermic circulatory arrest. Further investigation is required to better delineate which measures may reduce sex-related outcome differences after complex aortic surgery.

AB  - Background: The influence of sex on regression of left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy (LVH) after aortic valve replacement (AVR) for aortic stenosis (AS) remains elusive. The lack of consensus on how to correct LV mass (LVM) for body size, and different normalcy values, contribute to inconclusive results. Methods: In 164 consecutive patients (mean age 80 ± 4 years, 59% females) with AS, we analyzed LVM (Devereux formula) before and 1 year after AVR (St.Jude Trifecta bio-prosthesis). LVM was indexed to BSA (Du Bois and Gehan formulas), to height1.7 and height2.7. Limits of normalcy were (women and men, respectively): <95 and <115 g/m², BSA-indexed LVM; <60 and <81 g/m, LVM/height1.7; <44 and <48 g/m, LVM/height2.7. Results: Women had smaller BSA, but not body mass index, than men. AS severity and incidence of hypertension did not differ. LVM indexed to height2.7 was greater in women. LVH incidence was similar in males and females. Independently of the indexation method, LVH reduced significantly (P < 0.0001). LVM reduction was greater in women (P < 0.05 for all methods). At follow-up, nearly half the patients, irrespective of sex, showed residual LVH, and diastolic dysfunction. Conclusions: We tested different methods of LVM indexation in AS patients. LVM was similar between men and women. Indexation to height2.7 gives higher LVM in women because of their shorter stature. LVH prevalence is independent of sex. Irrespective of the indexation method, LVM reduction is greater in females, whereas LVM normalization occurs in equal proportion. Persistent LVH and diastolic dysfunction suggest earlier AVR in elderly.

AB  - Valvular heart disease and heart failure remain important causes of cardiovascular disease among women in the United States. Mitral regurgitation, aortic stenosis, and tricuspid regurgitation are the most common valvular lesions among men and women. This review focuses on gender differences in the epidemiology, treatment, and outcomes of mitral regurgitation, aortic stenosis, and tricuspid regurgitation. The authors also review the unique management of valvular heart disease in pregnancy.

AB  - Objectives: The aim of this study was to establish sex differences in remodeling and outcome in aortic stenosis (AS) and their associations with biomarkers of myocardial fibrosis. Background: The remodeling response and timing of symptoms is highly variable in AS, and sex plays an important role. Methods: A total of 174 patients (133 men, mean age 66.2 ± 13.3 years) with asymptomatic moderate to severe AS underwent comprehensive stress cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, transthoracic echocardiography, and biomarker analysis (matrix metalloproteinase [MMP]-2, -3, -7, -8, and -9; tissue inhibitor matrix metalloproteinases-1 and -4; syndecan-1 and -4; and N-terminal pro–B-type natriuretic peptide), and were followed up at 6-month intervals. A primary endpoint was a composite of typical AS symptoms necessitating referral for aortic valve replacement, cardiovascular death, or major adverse cardiovascular events. Results: For a similar severity of AS, male patients demonstrated higher indexed left ventricular (LV) volumes and mass, more concentric remodeling (higher LV mass/volume), a trend to more late gadolinium enhancement (present in 51.1% men vs. 34.1% women; p = 0.057), and higher extracellular volume index than female patients (13.27 [interquartile range (IQR): 11.5 to 17.0] vs. 11.53 [IQR: 10.5 to 13.5] ml/m2, p = 0.017), with worse systolic and diastolic function and higher MMP-3 and syndecan-4 levels, whereas female patients had higher septal E/e′. Male sex was independently associated with indexed LV mass (β = 13.32 [IQR: 9.59 to 17.05]; p < 0.001). During median follow-up of 374 (IQR: 351 to 498) days, a primary outcome, driven by spontaneous symptom onset, occurred in 21.8% of male and 43.9% of female patients (relative risk: 0.50 [95% confidence interval: 0.31 to 0.80]; p = 0.004). Measures of AS severity were associated with the primary outcome in both sexes, whereas N-terminal pro–B-type natriuretic peptide, MMP-3, and mass/volume were only associated in men. Conclusions: In AS, women tolerate pressure overload with less concentric remodeling and myocardial fibrosis but are more likely to develop symptoms. This may be related to higher wall stress and filling pressures in women.

AB  - Objectives: Acute type A aortic dissection (AAD) is a life-threatening disease. No differences between men and women have been made in the treatment of AAD so far and little is known about gender differences. This study aims to compare the short and long-term results of men and women after surgical treatment of AAD. Methods: Between Jume 2004 and June 2018, a total of 636 patients were operated for AAD. Patients were identified and retrospectively analyzed for their demographics, comorbidities, operative details, postoperative course, short- and long-term outcomes. Mean age was 63.9 ± 13.7 years, 230/636 (36.2%) were women, and 406/636 (63.8%) were men. Results: Mean age was significantly higher in women compared to men (67.9 ± 13.5 vs 61.6 ± 13.3, p < 0.001). Significantly less DeBakey Type I AAD was found in women (63.04 vs. 73.64%, p = 0.005). Comorbidities and preoperative status at the time of presentation were similar in women and men. Although similar malperfusion rates were found, men demonstrated a significantly higher rate of coronary malperfusion (6.08 vs. 11.57%, p = 0.024). Bicuspid aortic valve (0.87 vs. 4.92%, p = 0.007) and aortic valve insufficiency > II° (69.13 vs. 76.6%, p = 0.039) were more frequently found in men. The in-hospital mortality rate was similar in women and men (10.0 vs. 11.33%, p = 0.604). Ten-year survival rates of in-hospital survivors were significantly lower in women compared to men (51.9 vs. 72.8%, p = 0.007). Subgroup analysis of different age groups (>76 years, n = 121; 55-75 years, n = 283; < 55 years, n = 163) demonstrated superior long-term outcome for women >76 years (57 vs. 15%, p = 0.016). Similar outcome between men and women aged 55 to 76 years (61 vs 75%, p = 0.194) and inferior outcome for women younger than 55 years (82 vs. 91%, p = 0.027) was found. Conclusions: Although women with AAD are significantly older and significant differences of the extent of the dissection as well as the aortic valve pathologies were found between women and men, in-hospital mortality and short-term outcome are similar. The difference in long-term survival is not due to the higher age of women at the time of surgery, a subgroup analysis of older patients showed a better survival of older women and similar survival of middle-aged women. Especially women under 55 years of age are at risk after AAD. This effect could be caused due to the hormonal situation in younger female patients or the existence of primary connective tissue diseases and should be considered during close follow-up.

AB  - Background: The aortic valve replacement/neocuspidiza-tion using autologous pericardium (OZAKI technique) has gained popularity within the last years. Before using the autologous pericardium to reconstruct the valve, it is treated with glutaraldehyde (GA) for 10 minutes according the Ozaki's original publication. However, it is unclear, if longer intraoperative GA treatment (20 minutes) would enhance the pericardium mechanical stability and strength. Methods: After OZAKI valve replacement, leftover pericardium in 6 patients (3 males and 3 females) was bisected directly postoperatively and one half was treated for another 10 minutes (20 minutes in total). Strip samples of 25 x 5 mm2 were cut with randomized orientations to average the high tissue anisotropy and used to evaluate the differences in strength and stability performing standard uniaxial tensile tests (MTS Synergy). For each specimen, thickness profiles were reconstructed and measured by in-house developed image processing algorithms (Mat-lab 2017b, Mathworks) necessary to calculate the resistant cross-section defined as the section at the minimum thickness (width x minimum thickness). Thus, stress-strain curves were elaborated and ultimate tensile strength (UTS), ultimate tensile strain (uts) and collagen elastic modulus were calculated as engineering stress at the minimum resistant cross-section. Two-tailed t-test was performed to compare the two different experimental groups. Results: Uniaxial stretching generated elongations at rupture of 25 ± 7% vs. 22 ± 5% (10 vs. 20 min, p=0.05) corresponding to UTS values reaching 5.16 ± 2 and 6.54 ± 3 MPa (p=0.59), respectively. The high standard deviation values resulted from the highly anisotropy of the tissue, which was averaged by randomizing sample orientation and from gender differences (6.17 vs. 8.62 MPa, for males and 4.22 vs. 4.62 MPa for females). Interestingly, the elastic modulus E representing the stiffness properties of the collagen fibres showed similar values after treating the pericardium for 10 or 20 mins with E values between 31.80 ± 15.05 and 37.35 ± 15.78 MPa (p=0.25,10 and 20 min, respectively). Conclusions: With this study we showed that doubling of fixation time did not result in significantly different outcomes compared to the operative procedure in regard to pericardium mechanical stability quantified in terms of elastic modulus and ultimate tensile strength and strain.

AB  - Background. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has been demonstrated to be a feasible safe alternative treatment to surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) for severe aortic stenosis (AS), however discrepant data have been reported in relation to gender. The study aimed to examine gender differences in long-term clinical outcomes in a real-world TAVR cohort. Methods. All comer intermediate- to high-risk patients with severe AS treated with TAVR with a Medtronic valve (Corevalve, Evolut R and Evolut Pro) across 17 Italian sites were prospectively included in the Italian ClinicalService Project (clinicaltrials.gov NCT01007474) between July 2007 and May 2019. The primary endpoint was 1- and 3-years all cause of death. Results. Out of 3821 patients, 2149 (56.2%) women were enrolled. Compared to men, women were older (83±6 vs 81±6, p<0.001), more likely to present severe renal impairment (GFR ≤30ml/min, 26.3% vs 16.3%, p<0.001) but less previous cardiovascular disease (p<0.001). Mean European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation (EuroSCORE) I was not significantly different between males and females (19.8 ± 15.5% vs 19.2 ± 13.3%, p=0.355), while mean Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) score was higher in women (7.8 ± 7.1% vs 7.2 ± 7.5, p<0.001). Women presented a more pronounced mean aortic gradient (52.4±15.3 vs 47.3±12.8, p<0.001), and a better left ventricular ejection fraction (54.3± 11.2 vs 49.7± 12.7, p<0.001). TAVR was performed more frequently via transfemoral access in women (87.2% vs 82.1%, p<0.001). Major vascular complications and life-threating bleeding happened more frequently in women (3.9% vs 2.4%, p=0.012 and 2.5% vs 1.4%, p=0.024, respectively). The primary endpoint occurred in 248 patients (11.5% female vs 15.0% male, p=0.002) at 1 year and in 425 patients (19.8% female vs 24.9% male, p<0.001) at 3 years. KM-curves showed a higher all-cause death risk at 1- and 3-years in men compared to women (HR1yr 1.32, 95%IC 1.10- 1.57, p= 0.002 and HR3yr 1.34, 95%IC 1.17-1.53, p<0.001). After adjustment for significant confounding variables by a stepwise regression model, men remained at higher risk of death at 1- and 3-years (Adj. HR1yr 1.47, 95%IC 1.18-1.82, p< 0.001 and Adj. HR3yr 1.42, 95%IC 1.21-1.68, p<0.001). Conclusions. Intermediate to high-risk women included in this multicenter prospective real-world contemporary TAVR project experienced a 1-year and 3-year lower mortality compared to men, but with a significant higher risk of major vascular complications and lifethreating bleeding. These data suggest that women present a higher and earlier vascular risk compared to men, however a better long-term survival after TAVR. (Figure Presented) .

AB  - Introduction: Little is known about sex-related differences among patients with paradoxical low-flow aortic stenosis (PLF AS). Hypothesis: Women and men have different thresholds for defining low-flow and this may affect outcomes after AVR. Methods: We analyzed clinical, Doppler-echocardiographic and outcome data prospectively collected in 1490 patients with severe AS and preserved LVEF who underwent AVR. Results: There were 946 (63%) men and 544 (37%) women. Normal flow was present in 1006 (67%) and PLF in 484 (33%) patients. During a follow-up of 2.4 [1.04-4.29] years 167 patients died. Overall, patients with PLF had increased 30-day (10 [2.3%] vs 8 [0.9%], p=0.03) and cumulative all-cause mortality (HR=1.60 [95% CI: 1.17-2.18], p<0.01). PLF remained independently associated to increased mortality after comprehensive multivariate adjustment (HR=1.53 [95% CI: 1.11-2.11], p<0.01). Altogether, women had higher 30-day mortality than men (2.3% vs 0.8%, p=0.026), but similar cumulative mortality (p=0.39). Using guidelines threshold of 35 ml/m, PLF was associated with increased mortality in women (HR=1.95 [95% CI: 1.18-3.22], p<0.01), but not in men (HR=1.25 [95% CI: 0.79-1.85], p=0.39). Optimal thresholds were obtained for men (<40 ml/m, figure 1A) and women (<32 ml/m, 1B). Using these sex-specific cutpoints, PLF was independently associated with increased mortality in both women (adjusted HR=2.05 [95% CI: 1.21-3.47], p<0.01) and men (adjusted HR=1.54 [95% CI 1.02-2.32], p=0.042) (1C) and improved risk stratification in the whole cohort. Conclusion: Using the guidelines SVi cut-point (<35 ml/m), PLF is associated with increased overall mortality after AVR in the whole cohort and in women, but not in men. Defining PLF using thresholds of 40 ml/m for men and 32 ml/m for women predicted mortality in both sex categories. Our results support the utilization of sex-specific thresholds to define low-flow and enhance risk stratification in AS.

AB  - Introduction: Worse outcomes have been reported for females presenting with type A acute aortic dissection (TAAD), with a prior International Registry of Acute Aortic Dissection (IRAD) study finding higher in-hospital and surgical mortality rates. We sought to determine sex-specific operative approaches and outcomes for TAAD in the current era. Methods: The Interventional Cohort (IVC) of the IRAD database was queried to explore sex differences in demographics, imaging characteristics, clinical presentation, operative approach and outcomes. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to identify adjusted outcomes in relation to sex. Results: Females constituted approximately one-third (34.3%) of the 2,823 patients in the IRAD-IVC cohort and were significantly older than males (65.4 vs 58.6 years, p<0.001). Females were more likely to present with intramural hematoma (IMH), periaortic hematoma, or complete or partial false lumen thrombosis (all p<0.05) and more commonly had hypotension or coma (p=0.001 for both). Stratified by quartile, aortic valve sparing, hemi-arch replacement and cerebral perfusion increased significantly over time in both sexes (all p<0.05), with men undergoing a greater proportion of Bentall, complete arch, and elephant trunk procedures (all p<0.01). In-hospital mortality during the study period was higher in females (16.7% vs 13.8%, p=0.039). Following adjustment, female sex remained a significant predictor of in-hospital mortality overall (odds ratio 1.53, p=0.014) but not in the last decade of enrollment (odds ratio 0.95, p=0.868). Five-year mortality and reintervention rates were not significantly different between the sexes. Conclusions: In-hospital mortality remains higher among females with TAAD but demonstrates improvement in the last decade. Significant differences in presentation were noted in females including older age, distinct imaging findings, and greater evidence of malperfusion. Though no significant differences in 5-year mortality or reintervention were observed, a tailored surgical and management approach should be considered to reduce sex disparities in early death rates for TAAD.

AB  - Introduction: Gender-related differences are known about pathophysiology and clinical outcome of aortic stenosis (AS). Nevertheless, the impact due to gender on effort intolerance as well as its mechanisms has not been defined. Hypothesis: We sought to assess functional capacity in AS labelling gender differences. Methods: Sixty patients [age 69(63-76)years; female 24(40%)] with at least moderate AS (rest Vmax >3 m/s) underwent to rest and exercise echocardiography with simultaneous cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) during maximal symptom-limited exercise. Differences on echocardiographic and CPET variables were assessed according to gender. Results: Women showed lower effort tolerance [female vs male: workload 51(46.5-72.5) vs 92.5(74-118.5)watts, p<.0001; peakV02 13.2(12-15.2) vs 17.7(14.2-22-7)ml-/kg/min, p=.002; Predicted peakV02 63.5(53.5-74) vs 76(61.5-101)%, p=.006; anaerobic threshold 11.4(9.8-13.2) vs 12.8(11.4-15-7)ml-/kg/min, p=.01; VEA/C02 29.5(26.1-30.2) vs 26.2(24.3-28.5), p=.008] characterized by lower chronotropic reserve [age-predicted heart rate (HR) reserve 69.5(58.6-78.9) vs 82.8(74.6-89.7)%, p=.003; HR reserve 40.5(33.6-51) vs 47.5(39-67.5), p=.02; HR recovery at 1 min 9(4-12) vs 14(8.5-20), p=.002)], lower cardiac output (CO) response [exercise CO 7.9(6.4-8.8) vs 8.6(7.9-9.9) L/min, p=.01; CO reserve 2.9(2.1-3.6) vs 4.3(3.2-5.4)L, p=.0008] and lower peripheral extraction [C(A-V)V02 12(9.7-14.2) vs 15.4(13.8-16.6)ml-/100ml-, p=.0007]. At 12 months follow up, the incidence for AVR was 0.55(0.31 -0.73) in women and 0.29(0.15-0.45) in men, while at 60 months it was respectively 0.69(0.44-0.85) and 0.59(0.11-0.35). Conclusions: In women, moderate-to-severe AS generates a higher degree of functional limitation compared to men. A lower CO reserve, mainly determined by an impaired chronotropic response and lower C(A-V)02, plays a central role. This unfavourable phenotype is associated with a less advanced LV remodelling pattern and an earlier incidence of AVR.

AB  - Introduction: Severe aortic stenosis (AS) is a multifactorial, progressive condition that is associated with high short-term mortality. Risk factors for mortality have been described and include male sex, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and congenital bicuspid valve (BAV). Senile, calcific AS is thought to affect both genders equally in contrast to BAV which has a 3:1 male preponderance. It is unknown if there are gender differences in the prevalence of severe, senile AS or congenital bicuspid aortic valve in Whites compared to Blacks. Methods: 10,299 Black or White patients with severe aortic stenosis or bicuspid aortic valve treated at Cleveland Clinic with primary AVR from 1/1/2000 to 1/1/2017 were included in this study. There were 257 Black patients (2.5% of the study population). Categorical data on gender was compared using the Chi-squared test. Results: Blacks with severe aortic stenosis were significantly more likely to be female compared to Caucasians (55% vs 36%, p<0.001). There were no differences in gender prevalence among patients with BAV (73% vs 74%, p=0.88). Conclusions: Our study found that Blacks with severe AS undergoing AVR are significantly more likely to be female compared to Whites. However, there were no differences in gender prevalence among Blacks and Whites with BAVs. Although Black men are the least likely demographic to access health care, they comprise the majority of the BAV group. Thus, lack of health care access does not fully explain the gender differences in the severe AS group. There may be a strong underlying genetic component accounting for the 3:1 male predominance in all BAV patients. (Figure Presented).

AB  - Background: Cumulative findings from various worldwide cohorts have shown sex-related differences in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implan-tation (TAVI), yet data regarding the effect of TAVI evolution on sex-related differences are limited. Aims: To evaluate temporal trends in sex-related differences regarding demographic and echocardiographic characteristics, procedural and long-term outcome in patients undergoing TAVI. Method: We evaluated patients who underwent TAVI for severe symptomatic aortic stenosis from a national TAVI registry including four tertiary hospitals between the years 2008-2016. Results: Our final cohort included 1,358 female and 1,149 male patients. During 2008-2012, VARC-2 defined procedural success and procedural morality were comparable between male and female patients. However, male patients had an increased risk of significant para-valvular leak (p<0.001), pacemaker implantation (p=0.002) and stroke (p=0.004) compared to female patients. During 2013-2016, procedural mortality was higher in female patients compared to male patients, though VARC-2 defined procedural success rates were similar. Male and female patients exhibited similar rates of significant para-valvular leak, pacemaker implantation and stroke (p>0.1 for all comparisons). The cumulative incidence of death through 3 years of follow-up was significantly lower in female patients than in male patients during years 2008-2012, but not during years 2013-2016 (Figure). Multivariate analyses showed that female patients who underwent TAVI between years 2008-2012 had 26% lower risk of death compared to male patients (p=0.004), but there were no sex-related differences in mortality risk between the years 2013-2016 (HR=1.07, p=0.6, gender-by-year of procedure, p for interaction = 0.027). Conclusion: Female patients undergoing TAVI present with distinct baseline and procedure-related characteristics which may impact procedure related complications and long term outcome. Improved prognosis was observed among female versus male patients in the early TAVI period, but outcomes seem to balance in the current period.

AB  - Introduction: Aortic stenosis (AS) is associated with asymmetric left ventricular (LV) remodeling before and after aortic valve replacement (AVR), with residual hypertrophy associated with worse prognosis in women. Global LV mass does not capture regional differences, so we explored early remodeling and the influence of gender using a 3D approach. Methods: 116 patients with symptomatic severe AS (54% male, 70±10years) un-derwent clinical, echocardiography and cardiac MRI (CMR) evaluation before and one-year post AVR, (RELIEFAS). Global LV mass was indexed for body surface area (LVMi). Computational analysis of CMR short axis cine imaging produced co-registered 3D models of wall thickness and geometry. Perioperative changes were compared with age, gender and BSA matched healthy controls. Analysis was stratified by gender. Groups were compared by t tests and analysis of covari-ance, correcting for false discovery rate. Results: Although patients with AS had increased LVMi compared to matched controls, this was regional and showed septal concentric and lateral eccentric LV hypertrophy. [Figure Presented] Pre-operatively, AS patients with normal global mass and geometry (n=19, 79% female, mass:volume < 1.15) had greater inferior-septal wall thickness. Post-operatively, regression was localized to this region but still remained relatively hypertrophied compared to matched controls. Pre-operatively, male patients had greater LVMi than females and this was most pronounced in the mid-septum. Post-operatively, whilst global percentage LVMi regression was similar (-15±14% vs-10±18% p=0.07), the mid-septum showed greater percentage wall thickness regression in males (Figure 1). Conclusion: 3D computational modeling reveals regionality and gender differences in LV hypertrophy and its regression following AVR, missed by conven-tional approaches. Patients with AS with normal conventional measures of geometry have a relatively hypertrophied inferior-septum, which regresses but does not normalize one year after AVR. Males have greater relative regression in septal wall thickness after AVR, and this may contribute to the disparity of outcomes post operatively. Funding Acknowledgements: British Heart Foundation.

AB  - Background: Females with aortic stenosis (AS) have more concentric left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy (LVH) than males suggesting a prevalent adaptive geometric pattern to pressure overload. Maladaptive remodeling at the time of surgery may influence the outcome after aortic valve replacement (AVR). Purpose: To analyze sex differences in the evolution of LV geometry and in the regression of LVH one-year after AVR. Methods: Clinical and echocardiographic data of 164 consecutive AS patients (80±4 years, 59% females) before and one-year after Trifecta AVR were analyzed. Two multidimensional indexes were the output of factor analysis: LV index directly correlated with LV mass (LVM) and diameter (LVD) and inversely correlated with relative wall thickness (RWT), and pressure overload index correlated with transvalvular and transprosthetic mean and peak pressure gradient. LV index classified LVH pattern as adaptive or maladaptive: positive LVH index reflects maladaptive stages of LVH. Methods: Preoperative and one-year postoperative clinical and echocardiographic data were acquired according to ASE and EACVI recommendations. LVM (Devereux formula, ASE convention) was corrected either by body surface area (BSA-Du Bois), or by height∗∗ 1.7. Upper limits of normal values were: >95 g/m2 and >115 g/m2 for BSA, >60 g/m and >81 g/m for height∗ ∗ 1.7 (women and men, respectively). Results: Before AVR, 66% of females and 37% of males (p<0.001) had an adaptive geometric pattern characterized by smaller LVD, greater RWT, lower LVM and LVH incidence (p<0.001 for all). At one year, the adaptive geometric pattern had the same incidence and sex distribution as before surgery (64% of females and 36% of males, p<0.001). The direction of LV index changes was the same for the adaptive and maladaptive pattern both in females and in males, as shown in the figure. Overall, LV index increased in males, whereas it decreased in females. Central to the follow-up differences in LV index was LVD. Females with the adaptive pattern did not change their LVD at follow-up and that led to greater frequency of residual LVH than males (p<0.05). Females with the adaptive pattern had higher mitral E/e', suggesting a hemodynamic effect of the LVH persistence. Conversely, men with a maladaptive pattern did not reduce their LVD and exhibited less reduction in LVM than females with a maladaptive pattern, with greater incidence of residual LVH. Conclusion: After AVR, the adaptive LV geometric pattern in females is associated to higher incidence of residual hypertrophy with higher LV filling pressure, whereas persistent hypertrophy is more frequent in males with the maladaptive pattern.

AB  - Background: Few studies analyzed the influence of sex on the reversibility of left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy (LVH) in patients with aortic stenosis (AS) after aortic valve replacement (AVR). Results were not always consistent: LV mass (LVM) reduction was said to be greater in females either as absolute values or as body surface area (BSA)-indexed values, whereas complete regression of LVH was said to occur more likely either in males or in females. The lack of consensus on the most appropriate formula with which to correct LVM for body size, whether by simple indexation or by allometric correction, and different normalcy values may explain the differences. Purpose: To analyze the impact of different methods of LVM indexation on changes in LVM after AVR in females and males. Methods: Clinical and echocardiographic data of 164 consecutive severe AS patients (mean age 80±4 years, 59% females) before and one-year after St. Jude Trifecta AVR were analyzed. LVM was calculated using the Devereux formula (ASE convention) and was corrected either by BSA calculated with Du Bois or Gehan formulas, or by height raised to 1.7 or to 2.7 as exponents. Upper limits of normal values were (women and men, respectively): >95 g/m2 and >115 g/m2 for BSA-indexed LVM, >60 g/m and >81 g/m for LVM/height∗ ∗ 1.7 and >44 g/m and >48 g/m for LVM/height∗ ∗ 2.7. Results: Women had smaller BSA than men, but their body mass index was not different. AS severity and the incidence of arterial hypertension did not differ. LVM was higher in women only when corrected by height∗; ∗;2.7. LVH frequency was similar in males and females, and independently of the indexation method, it reduced significantly (p<0.0001). The reduction of indexed LVM strictly correlated to the preoperative value (p=0.01) and was greater in women (p<0.05 for all the indexation methods). At follow-up, nearly half the patients showed residual LVH, without significant difference between women and men (see figure). Conclusions: In this study we tested different methods of LVM indexation in AS patients and found that LVM is similar in men and women. LVM indexation for height∗; ∗;2.7 seems to overextimate LVM in women because of their shorter height. When the appropriate normalcy reference values are applied, the prevalence of LVH is independent of sex. Irrespective of the indexation method, LVM reduction is greater in females whereas LVM normalization occurs in equal proportion in women and men, facilitated by lower limits of normalcy in women.

AB  - Background: Sex differences in left ventricular (LV) remodelling have been described in pressure overload due to hypertension and aortic stenosis. There are no data on sex differences in response to volume overload. Purpose: To establish sex differences in remodelling in primary degenerative mitral regurgitation (MR) on serial assessment and their associations with biomarkers of myocardial fibrosis. Methods: Asymptomatic patients were included following diagnosis on echocardiography of moderate (20) or severe (14) MR. Subjects underwent cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR; 1.5T Siemens Alvanto) with tissue characterisation and cardiopulmonary exercise testing. Analysis of T1 (MOLLI), extracellular volume (ECV) and 3D feature tracking CMR were derived using Cvi42 (Circle, version5.3). Extracellular mass (ECM) was calculated as LV mass (LVM) x ECV; intracellular mass (ICM) was calculated as LVM x (1-ECV). Intraoperative cardiac biopsies were taken in patients undergoing surgery. Results: 32 asymptomatic patients (59±16 years; VO2 102±9%; 14 male) without history of ischaemic heart disease, diabetes or kidney disease (eGFR 74±21ml/min) were followed up for a median duration of 354 days (IQR 321-782). At entry for a similar severity of MR, male patients had higher indexed LV mass, more concentric remodelling (higher LV mass/volume), and lower ECV (but higher ECM) than female patients (Table 1a). In a backward stepwise linear regression model containing sex, indexed LV volumes and MR severity, sex remained the only independent predictor of ECV (R2=0.29, P=0.002). During follow-up, there were no overall changes in LV volume, mass, or MR severity. In men but not women however, increasing ECV correlated with markers of impaired function, including increasing indexed LV systolic volume (LVESV; R= 0.61, P=0.02, Figure 1A). There was an increase in ECM in men (31.6±6.0 vs 34.5±8.5, P=0.04) but not women (23.7±5.1 vs 24.3±5.1, P=0.24) with no parallel increase in cell hypertrophy: (ICM: men 98.3±21.3 to 99.9±21.0, P=0.45; women 63.1±13.7 vs 64.5±15.2, P=0.36). On follow-up CMR, ECV correlated with increased T2 values (R=0.56, P=0.001) in the whole cohort. 2 men proceeded to surgery on class II indications. Myocardial fibrosis was noted in up to 44% of the myocardium in a patient with ECV of 0.29 (Figure 1B), versus only 6% fibrosis in ECV of 0.22. Conclusions: In stable asymptomatic primary MR, men tolerate volume overload less well than women with increased ECV associated with increasing LVESVi and falling LVEF, both markers of adverse prognosis. These changes were not associated with change in LV mass or evidence of cell hypertrophy but did correlate with increased T2, as well as early histology data, suggesting a potential role for both fibrosis and myocardial oedema.

AB  - Background: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is a less invasive alternative approach to surgery. Individual randomized clinical trials evaluating the safety and efficacy of TAVR were mostly underpowered for conducting separate analyses for women and men. We pooled data from premarket TAVR clinical trials comparing short (30 days)- and long-term (∼2 years) outcomes by sex. Methods: Patient-level data from the TAVR arms of six clinical trials were pooled (2515 patients). Random-effects models for time-to-event outcomes (odds ratios [ORs] for 30-day outcomes and hazard ratios [HRs] for complete follow-up for mortality, ischemic stroke, kidney injury, major bleeding, myocardial infarction, and device migration) and dichotomous outcomes (ORs for reintervention, rehospitalization, and pacemaker implantation) were then fit to directly compare outcomes between women and men. Results: Overall, the pattern of individual comorbidities was more severe in men. There was no difference in mortality risk at 30 days (female-to-male OR = 1.00 [0.69-1.46]); however, at follow-up completion (∼2 years post-TAVR), women had a 24% lower mortality risk than men (HR = 0.76 [95% CI: 0.65-0.89]). Women also had a 30% lower risk of kidney injury at 30 days (OR = 0.70 [0.49-0.98]), which increased to 33% over the complete follow-up period (HR = 0.67 [0.51-0.87]). Major bleeding was more common in women compared to men at both 30 days (OR = 1.44 [1.19-1.76]) and long-term follow-up (HR = 1.22 [1.04-1.43]). For dichotomous outcomes, women had a 68% lower risk for reinterventions (OR = 0.32 [0.18-0.58]). We did not observe any difference in the risk of ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, device migration, rehospitalizations, or pacemaker implantations between sexes. Conclusions: This patient-level data meta-analysis of six premarket clinical trials found that women who received TAVR had fewer comorbidities at baseline. Acute outcomes (30 day) with respect to mortality were similar. Women were observed to have a lower risk of kidney injury, but higher risk of major bleeding compared to men receiving TAVR at 30 days. At complete follow-up, statistically significant advantages for women emerged in improved survival and lower reintervention risk. No differences in ischemic stroke, pacemaker implantation, or rehospitalization were observed. That women are healthier at baseline and develop fewer postprocedural complications than men may explain their higher survival.

AB  - Female gender has been linked to increased risk of adverse events after surgical aortic valve replacement; however, the evidence regarding the role of gender differences on clinical outcomes in patients who underwent transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is still debated. This retrospective study included 910 consecutive patients with severe, symptomatic aortic stenosis who underwent TAVI in 2 institutions from January 2012 to July 2016. The primary end point was all-cause mortality at 1 year after TAVI in women versus men. Women had a higher incidence of in-hospital vascular complications (7.8% vs 4.1%) and major or life-threatening bleeding (4.0% vs 1.6%) than men. At 1 year, women showed a lower mortality rate than men (7.0% vs 12.7%, adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0.42, 95% confidence interval [CI] [0.23 to 0.76], p = 0.004). When stratifying by specific subgroups of interest, the survival benefit in women persisted in (1) patients with a Society of Thoracic Surgery risk score ≤ 8 (adjusted HR 0.35, 95% CI [0.14 to 0.88], p = 0.026); (2) patients treated with first-generation devices (adjusted HR 0.46, 95% CI [0.24 to 0.86], p = 0.016); and (3) patients treated with balloon-expandable valves (adjusted HR 0.40, 95% CI [0.19 to 0.86], p = 0.019). In conclusion, in this large patient cohort, women had lower 1-year mortality after TAVI than men, particularly with an STS score ≤ 8, or treated with first-generation and balloon-expandable devices.

AB  - Background: Women undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) are known to have differences in baseline characteristics and outcomes when compared to men. As the TAVR-eligible population grows, it is essential to identify characteristics that could change management and assist in prognostication. Methods: Consecutive commercial-use TAVR patients were treated at an urban institution in northeastern United States. Male and female patients were analyzed for differences in baseline characteristics, comorbidities, procedural differences, and outcomes. Results: From 575 patients who underwent TAVR at our institution from 2012 to 2017, 423 commercial-use TAVR patients, of whom 192 were female (45.4%), were studied. Compared to men, fewer women had diabetes mellitus (32% vs 42%, p=0.024), prior MI (23% vs 39%, p<0.001), CABG (13% vs 34%, p<0.001), hemodynamically significant left main (7% vs 16%, p=0.006) and proximal LAD disease (12% vs 28%, p<0.001). Women also had lower body surface area (BSA) (1.76 vs 1.98 m2, p<0.001), pre-procedural creatinine (1.1 vs 1.6, p<0.001), and hemoglobin (11.1 vs. 11.4, p<0.001); and higher pre-procedural DLCO (69.2% vs 64.2%, p=0.03) compared to men. Mean STS Risk Score did not differ (9.97 vs. 9.45, p= 0.419). Annulus size was smaller in women (22.7 vs. 25.5 mm, p<0.001), but aortic valve peak velocities (4.31 vs. 4.07 m/s, p<0.001) and pre-procedural aortic valve mean gradient (47.1 vs. 40.5 mmHg, p<0.001) were higher. LVEF values were higher in the women: pre-procedure (59.1% vs. 49.2%), 30 day (59.8% vs. 51.4) and 1 year post procedure (60.8 vs. 49.9)(all, p<0.001). Access site did not differ: 80% of the women and 82% of the men underwent femoral access. Although there was no difference in fluoroscopic time (28.3 min vs. 28.5 min, p=0.845), fluoroscopy dose was lower in women (2,174 vs. 2958 kerm, p<0.001). Length of stay, in-hospital (women vs. men) (3% vs. 3%), and 1 year mortality, ischemic stroke (2% vs. 2%), new permanent pacemaker placement (20% vs.19%) did not differ between groups. Conclusion: Women undergoing TAVR had different baseline characteristics with similar post-procedural outcomes when compared with men.

T2  - Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions
AB  - Background: Percutaneous mitral balloon valvuloplasty (MBV) treats patients with moderate to severe mitral stenosis by widening the mitral valve allowing increased blood flow. There is minimal data demonstrating the effect gender has on in-hospital procedural outcomes. This study seeks to examine potential differences gender may have on MBV outcomes and complications. Methods: This retrospective cohort study utilized information from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) from 2012-2014. ICD-9 codes identified adult patients (≥18 years) with mitral stenosis (394.0, 394.2, 396.1, 434.0, 746.5) who underwent a mitral balloon valvuloplasty. Patients with concomitant aortic, tricuspid, or pulmonic stenosis, or missing important clinical identifiers (age, gender, death) were excluded. Inpatient mortality, hospital length of stay (LOS), inpatient charges, age, and comorbidities were assessed. Multivariate logistic regression was performed. Results: 234 patients who underwent percutaneous mitral balloon valvuloplasty including 68 male patients (29.8%) and 166 female patients (70.2%) were identified. Results of the multivariate logisitic regression are shown (Table 1). Conclusion: Analyses of patients undergoing treatment with percutaneous MBV suggests no gender differences in mortality, total charges, or LOS. There is increased risk of blood loss requiring transfusion in males undergoing MBV. No other secondary outcomes were noted to have significant differences after analyses. Periprocedural optimization may decrease blood loss outcomes in male patients. (Table presented).

AB  - Introduction: Sustained pressure overload (PO) stress can elicit in the left ventricle (LV) from aortic stenosis (AS) patients a harmful remodelling, characterized by cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and interstitial fibrosis. Regression of LV hypertrophy after aortic valve replacement (AVR) surgery exhibits sex-related differences. Repression of miR-29 and the consequent aberrant activity of the AKT pathway are key elements in the maladaptive LV remodelling. Both miR-29 and AKT exhibit gender-related dysregulation under different pathological conditions. Purpose: To study sex-specific expression patterns of miR-29b and its target AKT-3 in the LV myocardium of AS patients, and of mice subjected to transverse aortic constriction (TAC) and after TAC release (de-TAC). Methods: The subjects of the study were AS patients of both sexes and male and female mice subjected to TAC (4 weeks) and de-TAC (1 week). LV expressions of miR-29 and AKT-3 were determined by qPCR. Primary fibroblasts were isolated from mouse LV. LV morph-functional changes were followed by echocardiography. Results: LV miR-29b was downregulated in male mice (fold-change = 0.660.1∗) while up-regulated in females (fold-change: 2.760.8∗) after TAC. MiR-29b and its target AKT3 correlated negatively (r = -0.52∗∗) only in females. AKT3 mRNA levels correlated positively with the interventricular septum thickness (r=0.57∗), posterior wall thicknesses (r=0.5∗∗) and LV mass (r=0.54∗∗) in female, but not in males. Regression of LV hypertrophy after de-TAC was higher in females than in males (13.4 % vs 6.8%) and the LV expression of AKT3 was lower in in females than in males (7.361.3 vs 10.561.1∗). Females subjected to oophorectomy presented after TAC higher LV levels of AKT3 compared to intact females (6.161.0 vs 3.260.2∗). In cultured primary fibroblasts, the profibrotic effect of rTGF-beta mediated by miR-29b down-regulation was observed in cells obtained from males only. In female primary fibroblasts, oestrogens induced dose-dependent upregulation of miR-29 and down-regulation of AKT-3. Linear regression analysis revealed myocardial AKT-3 expression as a predictor of LV mass regression after AVR in AS women but not in men. Conclusion: Mir-29b and its target AKT-3 exhibit a sex-specific regulation in the LV under PO. AKT-3 overexpression is related with maladaptive hypertrophy in TAC-female mice and in AS women. These results provide insights on the molecular mechanisms involved in gender-related differences in cardiac remodelling.

TI  - Sex-related Differences in Calcific Aortic Valve Stenosis: Pathophysiology, Epidemiology, Etiology, Diagnosis, Presentation, and Outcomes
AU  - Hervault, M.

T2  - Structural Heart
AB  - Although sex-related differences in aortic valve stenosis (AS) have been published since the 1990s, the extent and complexity of the impact of sex on AS remains incompletely understood. Indeed, male sex has been a well-known risk factor of AS for several years. Thus, AS pathophysiology has been traditionally studied in male cohorts or in cohorts with a large majority of men, explaining the very scarce data regarding sex-specific pathophysiology of AS. However, recent evidence demonstrated the existence of sex differences in AS lesion and thus probably pathophysiology. Moreover, in recent population-based studies, AS occurred more often for men only in young patients (linked to bicuspid aortic valve) while after 75 years of age, female sex seems to be more prevalent. Interestingly, at diagnosis, comorbidities, symptoms or AS severity may be different according to the sex of the patients. Moreover, due to a sex-specific remodeling of the left ventricle, the pattern of AS itself is different, with more women presenting paradoxical low flow low gradient AS. Interestingly, outcomes are also sex-specific, and probably therapy-specific too, with a better outcome in men after open heart surgery but a better outcome in women after transcatheter aortic valve replacement. The aim of this review is to report the impact of sex on AS etiology, epidemiology, management, and outcome, and explore the hypotheses on sex-related differences in the pathophysiology’s mechanisms of AS. In particular, sex hormones, sex chromosomes, and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system will be discussed.

AB  - Background: The impact of sex-differences on mortality is unknown after transacted aortic valve implantation (TAVI) in Japanese patients. We assessed the impact of sex-related differences in mid-term mortality and left ventricular (LV) remodeling after TAVI. Methods: We included 1613 consecutive patients enrolled in the Optimized CathEter vAlvular iNtervention (OCEAN)-TAVI Japanese multicenter registry between October 2013 and July 2016. We retrospectively analyzed gender-related differences in mid-term all-cause mortality, and assessed major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) after TAVI. Furthermore, we evaluated the LV mass index (LVMI) 6 months after TAVI. Results: In our cohort, 1136 (70.4%) patients were women. The 30 days all-cause mortality was not signifcantly different between men and women (2.5% vs. 1.4%, p=0.143). Women had a higher incidence of major vascular complications than men (6.9% vs. 2.3%, p<0.001). Female gender was signifcantly associated with lower all-cause mortality and a lower incidence of MACE (log-rank p=0.037 in both). Multivariate analysis showed that male gender was independently associated with cumulative mid-term mortality (hazard ratio, 1.397; 95% confdence interval, 1.023-1.906; p=0.035). Echocardiogram indicated a signifcantly lower LVMI in women than in men at both baseline and 6 months after TAVI. LVMI regression after TAVI was observed in both women and men. Conclusion: Using data from a Japanese registry, we can find that women are associated with better survival outcomes, regardless of the higher rate of major vascular complications. LV remodeling is observed in both women and men after TAVI.

AB  - Objectives This study sought to examine long-term outcomes with transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) in women versus men. Background TAVR is commonly performed in women. Previous studies have shown conflicting results with respect to sex differences in outcomes with TAVR. In addition, short-term outcomes have primarily been reported. Methods Electronic search was performed until March 2017 for studies reporting outcomes with TAVR in women versus men. Random effects DerSimonian-Laird risk ratios were calculated. Outcomes included all-cause mortality and major cardiovascular events at short- (30 days) and long-term (>1 year) follow-up. Results Seventeen studies (8 TAVR registries; 47,188 patients; 49.4% women) were analyzed. Women were older but exhibited fewer comorbidities. At 30 days, women had more bleeding (p < 0.001), vascular complications (p < 0.001), and stroke/transient ischemic attack (p = 0.02), without difference in all-cause (p = 0.19) or cardiovascular mortality (p = 0.91) compared with men. However, female sex was associated with lower all-cause mortality at 1 year (risk ratio: 0.85; 95% confidence interval: 0.79 to 0.91; p < 0.001), and longest available follow-up (mean 3.28 ± 1.04 years; risk ratio: 0.86; 95% confidence interval: 0.81 to 0.92; p < 0.001), potentially caused by less moderate/severe aortic insufficiency (p = 0.001), and lower cardiovascular mortality (p = 0.009). The female survival advantage remained consistent across multiple secondary analyses. The risk of stroke, moderate/severe aortic insufficiency, and all-cause mortality seemed to vary based on the type of valve used; however, without significant subgroup interactions. Conclusions Despite a higher upfront risk of complications, women derive a better long-term survival after TAVR compared with men.

AB  - Objectives The purpose of this study was to identify sex-specific outcomes of intermediate risk patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement with the SAPIEN 3 valve. Background A survival difference has been observed in women as compared with men in inoperable and high-risk patients receiving early-generation balloon-expandable valves for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Whether a sex-specific outcome difference persists with newer-generation valves and in lower-risk patients is unknown. Methods The PARTNER (Placement of Aortic Transcatheter Valves) II S3 trial included high-risk (HR) (Society of Thoracic Surgeons risk score >8% or heart team determination) and intermediate-risk (IR) (Society of Thoracic Surgeons risk score 4% to 8% or heart team determination) patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis who were treated with TAVR with the SAPIEN 3 valve. Patient characteristics and clinical outcomes at 30 days and 1 year were compared by sex. Results Between October 2013 and December 2014, 1,661 patients were enrolled: 583 were HR (338 men, 245 women) and 1,078 were IR (666 men, 412 women). In both cohorts, women were more likely than men to be frail (22% vs. 13%; p < 0.001), but less likely to have comorbid conditions of renal insufficiency, coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Women were more likely to receive ≤23-mm valves (74.1% vs. 11.1%; p < 0.001) and were less likely to receive 29-mm valves (1.4% vs. 35.1%; p < 0.001). In the combined cohorts, there was no difference in mortality for women compared with men at 30 days (2.0% vs. 1.2%; p = 0.20) or 1 year (9.3% vs. 10.2%; p = 0.59). There were no differences in disabling stroke or any stroke at 30 days or 1 year; however, women had an increased rate of minor stroke at 30 days (2.1% vs. 0.7%; p = 0.01). Female sex was associated with increased major vascular complications (7.9% vs. 4.4%; p = 0.003), but not with moderate or severe paravalvular regurgitation. Notably, similar outcomes regarding sex-specific outcomes were obtained within stratified analyses of the HR and IR cohorts. Conclusions The study found no apparent sex-specific differences in survival or stroke in this trial of TAVR. This may reflect the changing demographic of patients enrolled, use of newer-generation valves with more sizes available, and more accurate valve sizing techniques.

TI  - Time of Anderson-Fabry Disease Detection and Cardiovascular Presentation
AU  - Selthofer-Relatic, K.
T2  - Case Reports in Cardiology
AB  - Background. Anderson-Fabry disease is an X-linked inherited disease, which manifests in a different manner depending on gender and genotype. Making a working diagnosis of Anderson-Fabry disease is difficult because of several reasons: (a) that it is a multiorgan disease with wide variety of phenotypes, (b) different timelines of presentation, (c) gender differences, and (d) possible coexistence with other comorbidities. Late-onset/cardiac type of presentation with minimal involvement of other organs can additionally make diagnosis difficult. Aim. To describe different cardiac manifestations at different time points in the course of the disease: (1) 72-year-old female (echocardiography detection), heterozygote, significant left and mild right ventricular hypertrophy; (2) 62-year-old male (echocardiography detection), hemizygote, left ventricular hypertrophy, implanted cardiac pacemaker, a performed percutaneous coronary intervention after myocardial infarction, degenerative medium degree aortic valve stenosis; (3) 45-year-old female (asymptomatic/family screening), heterozygote, thickened mitral papillary muscle, mild left ventricular hypertrophy, first degree diastolic dysfunction; and (4) 75-year-old female (symptomatic/family screening), heterozygote, cardiomyopathy with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction after heart surgery (mitral valve annuloplasty and plastic repair of the tricuspid valve). Conclusion. All patients have Anderson-Fabry disease but with different clinical presentations depending on the gender, the type of mutation, and the time of detection. All these features can make the patients' profiles unique and delay the time of detection.

T2  - American Journal of Cardiology
AB  - Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is a rapidly emerging procedure for the treatment of intermediate and high-surgical-risk patients with severe aortic stenosis. The impact of gender on in-hospital outcomes has not been studied on a large scale. The aim of this study was to examine gender differences in in-hospital outcomes after TAVI. The National Inpatient Sample (2012 to 2014) using the International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification procedure codes for TAVI (35.05 and 35.06) were used to form this database. Propensity score matching (1:1) was performed and in-hospital outcomes were compared. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Statistical analysis was performed using SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North Carolina). A total of 41,050 (weighted) patients were included in our study. Women accounted for 47.7% (n = 19,570) in our study and presented with older age (81.7 years vs 80.5 years, p ≤ 0.0001). The population was predominantly white (87.4%). After performing propensity score-matched analysis (1:1), no difference in the primary outcome was noted between men and women. The secondary outcomes including stroke, hemorrhage requiring transfusion, and pericardial complications were higher in women. The composite end point of death and stroke occurred more frequently in women than in men. Acute renal failure was higher in men. The post-TAVI length of stay was higher in women (8.3 days vs 7.7 days, p = 0.0007). In conclusion, this large, retrospective registry analysis of patients with severe aortic stenosis who underwent TAVI suggests women may experience higher rates of in-hospital morbidity compared with men.

AB  - Objective Some studies have shown sex differences in the pathophysiology of aortic stenosis (AS). However, sex-related outcome in AS remain unclear. We sought to investigate the prognostic impact of gender in a large cohort of AS. Methods A total of 2,348 patients with AS defined by aortic valve area (AVA) < 2 cm2 were included. The primary endpoint was long term overall mortality and the secondary endpoint, long-term cardiovascular mortality. Results A total of 1211 patients were men and 1137 women. At baseline, women were older (P < 0.001) and more symptomatic (P < 0.001) than men. Overall five-year survival was 70±4% for men and 65±3% for women (P < 0.001). However, on multivariate analysis, after adjustment for covariate of prognosis importance including age and symptoms, both sex found to have a similar long-term prognosis (adjusted HR: 0.882 [0.741-1.049]; P = 0.156) even after further adjustment for surgery (adjusted HR: 0.865 [0.745-1.003]; P = 0.055). For cardiovascular mortality, five-year survival was 88.5±1% for men and 85%±2% for women (P = 0.001). On multivariate analysis, there was no difference between genders (adjusted HR: 0.996 [0.760-1.304]; P = 0.976), even after further adjustment for surgery (adjusted HR: 1.000 [0.788-1.267]; P = 0.997). The results were similar in the subgroup of severe AS (n = 1608, 68%), except a slight increase in overall mortality for men after adjustment for surgery (adjusted HR: 0.782 [0.630-0.971]; P = 0.026) (Fig. 1). Conclusion The current study shows that female gender was a predictor of all cause and cardiovascular mortality in univariate analysis, but this over-risk disappears in the multivariate analysis for both, overall and severe AS population. Women were significantly older and more symptomatic than men, due to more severe AS at baseline, suggesting a delay in their AS management which need to be considered.

AB  - Objectives: Epidemiological studies demonstrated a gender related impact on AIE incidence. Data from animal studies suggested the protective effect of estrogen against endothelial cell damage. From clinical perspective, if AIE is present and surgery required, female gender seems to become an independent predictor for increased risk of early mortality. The aim of our prospective observational cohort study was to evaluate the impact of gender on presentation and outcome in AIE patients. Methods: Between April 2013 to June 2017, eighty patients, in which AIE was diagnosed based on clinical and histopathological examination, underwent aortic valve replacement (50 men, 30 women) at University Munich and Leipzig Heart Centers. Valvular tissue was examined (immunohistochemistry, molecular biology and microbiology). Plasma concentration of inflammatory cytokines was analyzed by ELISA. Gendered statistical analysis with regard to pre-, peri and postoperative risk (EuroSCORE 2 and logistic EuroSCORE) and outcome was performed using SPSS based exact Fisher's test, Chi squared and independent student's t-tests, respectively (p-value < 0.05). Results: Preoperative cardiogenic shock and preoperative neurologic dysfunction were pronounced among women (p = 0.037 and 0.013, respectively). Despite the fact, that major Duke's criteria were not distinct between men and women, men mainly expressed aortic regurgitation (AR) I-II, women AR 0-I. There was a tendency of men showing more positive blood cultures (p = 0.070). Bacterial distribution among female and male patients is demonstrating a distinction: Men most frequently suffered from Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus. Women were infected by S. aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus gallolyticus. Leucocytes and CRP were distributed equally; IL-6 as only inflammatory marker demonstrated a gender related distinction (p = 0.028). Risk stratification revealed a significantly higher risk for women (EuroSCORE 2, logistic EuroSCORE, risk of renal failure, risk of mortality and morbidity (single and as combined endpoint). Statistically important were longer hospital stay, higher rates of tracheotomy and newly developed neurologic dysfunction. Conclusion: In case of AIE presence and necessity of surgery, women are disadvantaged: They presented with higher disease stage and more clinical symptoms. The estimated risk and comorbidities of women are significantly higher compared with men. Further investigations are currently underway.

AB  - BACKGROUND The impact of gender on early outcomes following transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) in the setting of contemporary valves is not well known. We aimed to evaluate genderspecific differences on 30-day outcomes in adults undergoing TAVR with contemporary valves. METHODS The study population included 179 consecutive patients who underwent TAVR with a contemporary valve [Sapien 3 valve (Edwards Life Sciences, Irvine, CA) or CoreValve Evolut R or Evolut Pro (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN)] from December 2015-October 2017 at an academic tertiary medical center. RESULTS Of the 179 patients, 100 (55.9%) were men and 79 (44.1%) were women. Women had a trend towards older age (82 vs 79 years, p=0.065). They had lower serum creatinine (1.0 vs 1.6mg/dl, p=0.001) and hemoglobin (11.2 vs 12.2 g/dl) and higher platelet count (245 vs 193 K/uL). Women had lower rates of prior myocardial infarction, prior coronary artery bypass graft surgery, atrial fibrillation, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, abdominal aortic aneurysm, and less severe coronary artery disease. Women also had smaller aortic annular area (391 vs 502mm2, p<0.001) and perimeter (72.2 vs 81.7mm, p<0.001) and underwent implantation of small TAVR valves. Women had higher rates of periprocedural intubation and lower rates of conscious sedation. Women were also more likely to be discharged on aspirin (98.7%vs 88.9%, p=0.013) andmore likely to be sent to a skilled nursing facility (26.9% vs 14.1%, p=0.034). No significant differences in rates of 30-day outcomes were noted in men and women (Figure). CONCLUSIONS In this observational study of adults undergoing TAVR with contemporary valves, gender is not associated with higher rates of 30-day clinical outcomes. Further studies examining gender disparities in TAVR peri-procedural care and outcomes are warranted (Figure Presented).

AB  - BACKGROUND Limited data exists regarding gender differences in outcomes following transcatheter (TAVR) and surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR). We sought to review the published data and perform a systematic review to investigate differences in mortality between men and women following TAVR and SAVR. METHODS We systematically searched Medline from 1972 to May 2017 for randomized trials and observational studies examining the relationship between gender and mortality outcomes in patients following TAVR or SAVR. Two authors selected studies and extracted data independently. Studies were excluded if data regarding 30-day all-cause mortality were not provided for both men and women. RESULTS There were 34 articles, a total of 41,089 patients, enrolled in our systematic review and meta-analysis, including 22,894 men and 18,195 women. Of these 34 articles, 19 involved TAVR, 13 involved SAVR, and 2 involved both TAVR and SAVR. Rates of 30-day all-cause mortality following TAVR was noted to be similar in men and women [odds ratio (OR) 0.99, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.87 to 1.11]. Men had lower rates of 30-day all-cause mortality following SAVR compared to women (OR 0.72, 95% CI, 0.62 to 0.83) (Figure). CONCLUSIONS Female gender is associated with higher rates of mortality following SAVR. No significant differences in mortality were noted in men versus women following TAVR. (Figure Presented).

AB  - Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is a safe and effective therapy for aortic valve replacement in patients ineligible for or at high risk for surgery. However, outcomes after TAVR based on an individual's sex remain to be fully elucidated. We searched PUBMED and EMBASE using the keywords: "transcatheter aortic valve replacement," "transcatheter aortic valve implantation," "sex differences," "gender," "sex characteristics" and collected information on baseline features, procedural characteristics, and postprocedural outcomes in women. Inclusion/exclusion resulted in 23 publications. Women had less preexisting comorbidities than men. Most studies reported better survival in women (range of hazard ratio [95% CI] = 0.27 [0.09-0.84] to 0.91 [0.75-1.10]). At 30 days, women also had more vascular complications (6-20% vs 2-14%) and higher bleeding rates (10-44% vs 8-25%). Stroke rates were similar at 30 days (women, 1-7%; men, 1-5%). This literature review showed better survival in women than men after TAVR. However, women had more vascular complications and bleeding; stroke rates were similar. These findings may partly be explained by fewer baseline comorbidities in women. These results should be interpreted with caution as most measures only include unadjusted percentages.

AB  - Cardiac rehabilitation is able to reduce cardiovascular mortality, and improves functional capacity and quality of life. However, cardiac rehabilitation participation rates are low and the current evidence has demonstrated sex differences for the access to cardiac rehabilitation programs. In this review, we discuss the benefits of cardiac rehabilitation in women with a specific focus on ischemic heart disease, heart failure, cardiac rehabilitation after cardiac surgery and after transcatheter aortic valve implantation, and peripheral artery disease. We also analyse the current limitations to cardiac rehabilitation for women in terms of accessibility and indications, reporting general, sex-specific, and healthcare-related barriers. Finally, we discuss the potential solutions and areas of development for the coming years.

AB  - Background: Gender differences in valvular heart disease are increasingly recognised. Prior study has suggested better surgical outcomes in women with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis (AS). We investigate gender differences in medicallymanaged severe AS. Methods: We compared gender differences in clinical, echocardiographic characteristics and outcomes in 347 patients with isolated severe AS (aortic valve area<1cm ) with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) that were medicallymanaged. Univariate and multivariate analyses were employed, and KaplanMeier curves were constructed to compare mortality outcomes. Results: 205 (59%) patients were women. Despite higher incidences of hypertension (76% vs 43%) and diabetes mellitus (47% vs 30%) in women, they had better survival than men (KaplanMeier logrank= 6.24,p=0.012, Figure). After adjusting for age (Hazard ratio (HR) 1.034, 95%CI 1.014 1.054), hypertension (HR 1.469, 95%CI 0.807 2.673) and diabetes (HR 1.219, 95%CI 0.693 2.145) using Cox proportional hazards regression model, female gender remained independently associated with lower mortality (HR 0.561, 95%CI 0.332 0.947, p=0.030). Women tended to have smaller left ventricular sizes and smaller LV outflow tract diameter, but were similar to men in terms of LVEF, AS severity, and patterns of LV remodelling. Conclusions: Women have better outcomes compared to men in medicallymanaged isolated severe AS with normal LVEF. These gender differences warrant further study and may affect prognostication, followup and timing of valve surgery. (Table Presented).

AB  - Introduction: Recent registry-based studies have suggested that women have comparable outcomes to men after TAVR. We aimed to investigate this further by evaluating procedural use and outcomes among patients undergoing surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) and transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) from a large inpatient dataset in the United States. Methods: Retrospective analysis of longitudinal nationwide hospital data from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample was used to identify patients who underwent TAVR or SAVR in 2013. Descriptive analysis was used to examine differences in patient characteristics, and multivariate, hierarchical logistic regression was performed to determine the association of gender with inhospital mortality and pacemaker requirement after TAVR, with adjustment for age, comorbidities, payor type, income quartile, and race. Results: Women constituted 50% of admissions coded with aortic valve disease as the diagnosis. Women received 48% of the 2705 TAVRs performed and 35% of the 14,921 SAVRs performed. Women who received TAVR were older (82 +/-8 years for women vs. 81 +/-9 years for men, p<0.0001), but with lower Charlson comorbidity scores (2.5 for women vs. 2.9 for men, p<0.0001). Despite a lower burden of comorbidities, women suffered higher in-hospital mortality after TAVR (5.6% among women vs. 4.0% among men, p=0.05), and this effect size increased with adjustment for patient characteristics (OR=1.64 [CI 1.10-2.44], p=0.02). Women also had a longer TAVR hospital length of stay (9.2 +/-7 days among women vs. 8.4 +/-8 days among men, p=0.008). Women had no difference in permanent pacemaker requirement after TAVR, both before adjustment (9.3% among women vs. 9.9% among men, p=0.62) and after adjustment (OR=1.12 [0.93-1.36], (p=0.23). Conclusion: TAVR is more frequently chosen over SAVR as a treatment option for women with aortic valve disease despite their lower burden of comorbidities. However, women who received TAVR had worse in-hospital mortality than men. Further studies to determine causes of these sex differences should be pursued to elucidate how TAVR outcomes for women can be improved in the early post-procedure period.

AB  - BACKGROUND Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR) has undergone significant procedural refinement in last few years and has become standard treatment in various subgroups of patients with aortic stenosis. Previous meta-analysis have reported differential rates of complications in men and women, however large scale national data exploring gender differences appears sparse. METHODS We analyzed HCUP's Nationwide Inpatient Sample database from 2012-2014 using SAS and identified patients who underwent TAVR (ICD-9-CM procedural codes 35.05 and 35.06). Complications were identified using previously published ICD-9 codes and patient safety indicators. Hierarchical two level logistic models were used to evaluate study outcome of in hospital complications. RESULTS Of total 41015 (unweighted 8203) procedures included in our analysis (mean age 81.12 years, 81.3% White) 19560 procedures were on female patients. Univariate analysis revealed significantly higher rates of complications in females including any complications (36.94 % vs 32.18%, p< 0.0001), vascular complications (8.92 % vs 6.22%, p< 0.0001) and cardiac complications (21.4% vs 19.3%, p< 0.0001, Figure 1a). After adjusting for confounders, gender was an independent predictor of higher odds in females for these complications (Figure 1b). Interestingly, complications related to device/prosthesis were lower for women (3.38% vs 2.4%, p< 0.0001). CONCLUSION Women have higher rates of immediate post-TAVR cardiac and vascular complications which may be related to smaller aortic annuli and femoral diameters. This may further explain lower rates of device/prosthesis associated complications in women due to less para-valvular regurgitation and less prosthesis-patient mismatch. Our study suggests, novel gender based sizing references utilizing advanced imaging techniques to be used to minimize the associated complications.

AB  - BACKGROUND The role of gender on in hospital outcomes after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has been poorly investigated, mostly limited to single center studies or systematic reviews/meta analysis and lacks nationally representative US based data. Therefore, we investigated distinct gender based risk profiles and in-hospital outcomes. METHODS We analyzed data from HCUP's Nationwide Inpatient Sample database from 2012-2014 for ICD-9-CM procedural codes 35.05 and 35.06 for TAVR using SAS. Chi-squared and Student's t-test were used for univariate analysis of categorical variables and continuous variables respectively. Logistic regression analysis using PROC Surveylogistic was used for multivariable analysis for outcome of in hospital mortality while linear regression using PROC Surveyreg for outcomes of length of stay and cost of care. RESULTS 41015 (weighted) procedures from 2012 to 2014 were included in our analysis (mean age 81.12 years, 81.3% White). 47.69% of these were female patients. Compared to male, female group was older (mean 81.72 years vs 80.57 years, p< .0001) with significant differences in distribution of comorbidities (Table 1a). In-patient mortality (4.88% vs 3.64%, p< 0.0001), and length of stay were higher in female group on univariate analysis (8.34 days vs 7.7 days, p< 0.0001) but difference in cost of care was not statistically significant ($59,178 vs $57,935, p=0.076). After adjusting for confounders, female gender was an independent predictor of higher odds of in-hospital mortality (odds ratio 1.4, CI 1.11-1.70, p< 0.0001), longer LOS and higher cost of care. CONCLUSION Women compared to men undergoing TAVR have significantly different risk profile and are associated with higher in-hospital mortality, longer hospital stay and higher cost of care. Further randomized controlled studies confirming these observational findings are warranted and in turn may point to new areas of focus to continue ongoing improvement in procedural outcomes.

AB  - Background: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is very prevalent in patients with aortic valve disease. Decreased renal perfusion as a consequence of diminished cardiac output may contribute to this patient's renal disfuncion. Given the potential reversibility of this mechanism after valve correction, the aim of this study was to verify the impact of percutaneous transcatether aortic implantation (TAVI) on kidney function. Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of 233 consecutive patients that underwent TAVI and were included in single center prospective registry between November 2008 and May 2017. Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) was calculated using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) formula and we considered 3 groups according their eGFR (mL/min/1.73 m2 ); the categories sugested by Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) 2012 guidelines were mentioned for each group. Group 1 with eGFR≥60 included patients without CKD or CKD G1-2; Group 2 with 30≤eGFR<60 (CKD G3a-b); and Group 3 with eGFR<30 (CKD G4). Patients on dialysis were excluded from the analysis. Previous to TAVI, 43,1% were in Group 1, 44,0% in Group 2 and the remaining 12,9% in Group 3. Results: 56.7% were female and the mean age was 81.8plusmn;7.5years (from 47 to 94years). No age or gender differences were found between groups. In patients from Group 1, a 15% fall in eGFR was verified after 1year follow-up (table1). Conversely, in patients from Group 2 and Group 3 we observed a significant increase in eGFR after TAVI (table1). Conclusions: The association between worse outcomes in CKD patients undergoing TAVI is well established, but little is known about the potential reversibility of renal function after aortic valve replacement. We concluded that, for patients with moderateto-severe CKD, there is a gain of function in the first month post-TAVI, which increased further 1 year after the procedure. This is probably due to improved renal perfusion post-procedure. We postulate that when evaluating patients that might need TAVI, this 'reversibility of CKD effect' should be considered. (Table Presented).

AB  - Objective: Our objective was to evaluate sex-differences in outcomes after trans-catheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) in a population-based cohort from Ontario, Canada. Background: Prior studies comparing outcomes in men and women after TAVR have yielded divergent results. Some studies have suggested that women have better survival than men while others have not corroborated this finding. Methods: A retrospective observational cohort study was conducted using chart abstraction data on all TAVR procedures performed between 2007 and 2013 in Ontario, Canada. Patients who had emergency TAVR procedures were excluded. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality at 30-days and 1-year. Secondary outcomes included mortality at last follow-up, cause-specific, and all-cause hospital readmission. Inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) using propensity score was used to adjust for baseline differences between men and women. Results: The final study cohort consisted of 453 women and 546 men with a mean follow-up of 3.5 years. Women were generally older and more frail but had less comorbid conditions. Women had lower unadjusted mean EuroScores (7% ± 5% vs 8% ± 7%; P = 0.008), but underwent significantly more trans-apical procedures (26.5% vs 19.2%; P = 0.006) than men. After IPTW, the groups were well balanced. Although mortality was numerically higher for women at 30-days (7.2% vs 5.4%), this was not statistically significant (P = 0.34). At 1-year, there was no difference in mortality (18.2% vs 19.2%; P = 0.85). There were no significant differences in all-cause readmission. Conclusion: In this population-based cohort including all patients undergoing TAVR, mortality or all-cause readmission were not significantly different between men and women. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - In the United States, valvular heart disease (VHD) has a prevalence of 2.5%, most commonly presenting as aortic stenosis (AS) or mitral valve regurgitation (MR) and increasingly observed to be of a degenerative etiology. Women frequently have latent symptoms despite significant disease, and it is therefore pertinent to consider both clinical symptoms and imaging findings for decision-making on treatment. Indeed, significant advances have been made in noninvasive imaging allowing for more accurate diagnosis and disease prognostication. While echo remains the standard diagnostic test, multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provide complementary information on aortic valve calcification and left ventricular (LV) function, respectively. For any given calcification load or increase in calcification density of the aortic valve, women have greater increase in aortic valve stenosis severity than men; thus, moderate AS in women warrants closer attention. MRI allows identification of different patterns of hypertrophy and remodeling, extent of LV fibrosis, and insights into differential reverse remodeling and clinical outcomes in men and women. In conjunction with surgical treatment, percutaneous technologies are being increasingly used in the management of VHD. Nearly 50% of patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) are women. In high- or intermediate-risk subjects with significant symptomatic AS, TAVR has been shown to be noninferior to surgical AVR (SAVR). Notably, whereas both treatment strategies are equally effective in men, transfemoral TAVR has been shown to be superior to SAVR resulting in better survival in women. Analogously, few data have examined sex differences with percutaneous MitraClip devices in the treatment of degenerative MR, and men and women appear to have equivalent composite outcomes. Randomized clinical trial data are presently awaited for outcomes in the percutaneous treatment of functional MR secondary to ischemic heart disease. This review discusses the current evidence in the diagnosis and treatment of VHD with a focus on sex differences in left-sided VHD and management in women.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: We aimed to evaluate sex-related differences in short-term and long-term outcomes of patients undergoing balloon aortic valvuloplasty (BAV) for severe aortic stenosis (AS). METHODS: A total of 112 patients with severe AS underwent 114 BAV procedures as palliative procedure, bridge to definitive treatment, or before urgent non-cardiac surgery. Patients were followed for 24 months. RESULTS: Of the 112 patients, 70 (62.5%) were women. Women were older, and had a higher STS score and higher prevalence of chronic kidney disease and arterial hypertension. Indications for BAV did not differ by gender. Women had a higher risk of vascular complications than men (15.7% vs 0.0%; P≤.01), but with a similar rate of major periprocedural complications (17.1% vs 9.5%; P≤.40). Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) was performed in 22.8% of women and 26.2% of men (P≤.61) and surgical aortic valve replacement in 10% of women and 11.9% of men (P≤.70). Women and men treated finally with TAVI/aortic valve replacement had lower mortality as compared with conservative treatment (P<.01). No difference in in-hospital and 24-month mortality between women and men was observed (11.4% vs 4.9% [P≤.26]; 63.3% vs 39.0% [P≤.22], respectively). In a multivariable Cox model, STS score above 9.8% (hazard ratio, 2.29; 95% confidence interval, 1.09-4.83; P≤.03) was an independent predictor of all-cause death only in women. CONCLUSION: Despite the presence of sex-related differences in baseline and procedural characteristics as well as in the risk of vascular complications, no difference in major procedural complications and long-term mortality was confirmed for patients with severe AS undergoing BAV.

AB  - Background: Rheumatic heart disease is an autoimmune disease caused by group A streptococci infection and frequently affects the aortic valve. Sex differences are common in the disease progression, treatment, and outcome. However, little is known about the sex differences in the pathology of aortic valves in rheumatic heart disease. Design: We studied the end-stage calcific aortic valves from male versus female patients to reveal the sex-dependent pathology differences and molecular changes associated with requiring valve replacement. Methods: Aortic valves from 39 patients with rheumatic heart disease (19 males and 20 females) were collected at the time of aortic valve replacement for comparative pathology, immunohistochemistry, and gene expression analyses. Clinical characteristics were also analyzed and compared between the two groups. Results: Aortic valves from female patients exhibited increased expression of collagens, infiltration of monocytes/macrophages and neovascularization. Aortic valves from female patients also had increased expression of inflammatory genes involved in the NFKB pathway (phosphorylated NFKB p65 subunit, IL8, and NOS3) and Th1 cytokine genes (IFNA and IL12B). The severe valve pathology in female patients was correlated with a higher serum level of antistreptolysin O antibodies. Conclusion: Inflammation is more prominent in aortic valves of female patients with rheumatic heart disease. This sex difference may contribute to the severe valve pathology and worse outcome of female patients.

AB  - Background: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is a FDA approved procedure for severe, symptomatic aortic stenosis in high and intermediate surgical risk patients. Impact of gender on post-TVAR outcomes remains unknown Methods: Patients who underwent TAVR at two major tertiary care hospitals in US were included in this retrospective study. Summary statistics, linear regression and propensity score analysis were performed Results: All-comer patient population (N5303, 40% female & 60% males). Baseline characteristics and results summarized in Table 1. Women were more likely to undergo trans-apical approach, compared to men. Although, women were more likely to get a smaller valve size compared to men (25 vs 27.9 mm, p <0.001); the use of Sapien (Edwards LifeSciences) vs. CoreValve (Medtronics) was similar for both groups (p=0.19). In univariate regression analysis, the odds of periprocedural stroke, pacemaker implantation, perivalvular leak, bleeding event, in-hospital MAACE and in-hospital death were similar for females vs males (Table 1). Females were more likely to have longer length of hospital stay and had 2 fold increased odds of all-cause mortality at 12 months (2.25, 95%CI 0.96- 5.25, p=0.05). In a propensity score adjusted analysis, females continued to have a 5 fold increased odds of all-cause mortality at 12 months compared to males (OR 5.28, 95%CI 1.26-22.07, p=0.02; Table 1) Conclusion: In this propensity score adjusted analysis, women compared to men had higher risk of mortality at 12 months post TAVR. Our results need to be confirmed in larger, prospective studies.

AB  - Background: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is rapidly emerging procedure for the treatment of severe aortic stenosis, but impact of gender on in-hospital outcomes have not been studied on such a large scale. The aim of this study was to examine gender differences in in-hospital outcomes and length of stay after TAVR. Methods: National Inpatient Sample (NIS) 2012 through 2014 using the International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) procedure codes 35.05 and 35.06 was used to collect TAVR database. Baseline characteristics and in-hospital outcomes were compared between men and women. Primary outcome was Inhospital mortality. Analysis was performed using SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC). Results: A total of 41,050 (weighted) patients were involved in our study. Women accounted for 47.7% in our study and presented with higher age (80.5vs 81.7, P=<0.0001). Population was predominantly white (87.4%). Higher primary outcome of In-hospital mortality (4.9% vs 3.6%, p=<0.0001) and secondary outcomes (Cardiogenic shock, Stroke, Gastrointestinal hemorrhage and Blood loss requiring Transfusion) were seen with women compared with men [Table 2]. Length of stay was higher with women (8.3 vs 7.7, p=0.0001) [Table 1]. Conclusion: Based on the results of our study in this large database of severe aortic stenosis patients undergoing TAVR, women had higher morbidity and mortality compared to men. Further efforts should be made to reduce these adverse outcomes in women.

AB  - Background: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is standard of care for symptomatic severe aortic stenosis in high-risk surgical patients. Gender differences in outcomes of TAVR have been suggested. Methods: We compared outcomes of TAVR in women (n=4,603) and men (n=4,275) using 2011- 2012 Nationwide Inpatient Sample database. Results: Compared to men, women were older (mean age 81.8-vs-80.6 years, p<0.001) and had higher rates of hypertension (81%-vs- 79%, p=0.01), hypothyroidism (28%-vs-13%, p<0.001), and obesity (15%-vs-11%, p<0.001), but lower rates of renal failure (29%-vs-43%, p<0.001) and peripheral vascular disease (28%-vs-33%, p<0.001). Following TAVR, adjusted rates of all-cause in-hospital mortality (5%- vs-4.3%, p=0.38) and stroke (1.8%-vs-vs-1.1%, p=0.2) were similar between sexes while women had higher rates of vascular (injury, transfusion, and bleeding) and pericardial complications and lower rate of permanent pacemaker implantation during index hospitalization (Table). Women also had longer mean length of hospital stay (8.8-vs- 8.2 days, p<0.001) and more likely to be discharged to a long-term care facility (43.8%-vs-25.5%, p<0.001). Conclusions: Despite higher age and higher prevalence of co-morbid conditions, women undergoing TAVR experienced similar in-hospital mortality and post-procedure stroke rates. Higher procedural complication rates may account for longer hospital stay and need for skilled facility care following discharge in women. (Table Presented).

AB  - Background: Data on the impact of gender on outcomes of surgical aortic valve replacement (AVR) are controversial. In the STS risk score model, female gender was an independent risk factor for morbidity and mortality after AVR. However, several recent studies have suggested that the gender gap after AVR is narrowing. We sought to compare the gender differences in outcomes of aortic valve replacement. Methods: The 2004-2013 Nationwide Inpatient Sample was utilized to identify 138,092 patients who underwent isolated SAVR. Multivariable logistic regression derived propensity scores were sequenced and matched 1:1 to attain 45,557 matched pairs of isolated SAVR in males and females to assess in-hospital outcomes and cost. Results: Of 138,092 who underwent isolated AVR, only 86720 (37.2%) were females. In-hospital mortality was higher in females (5.6% vs 4.3%, p< 0.001), as were vascular complications (7.3% vs 6.6% %, p< 0.001), stroke (1.9% vs 1.5%, p=0.003), pacemaker implantation (7.3% vs 7%, p=0.007) and blood transfusions (41.8% vs 36.2%, p=< 0.001). Conclusions: Women undergo AVR much less frequently than men in a contemporary U. S Practice. Female gender is an independent predictor of mortality in patients undergoing aortic valve replacement. The advent of transcatheter aortic valve replacement and evidence of less mortality when compared to surgical aortic valve replacement.

AB  - Background Very little data exist on the impact of sex on aortic and arterial anatomy as relevant for transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). Objective To investigate whether patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) referred for TAVI display sex-specific differences in aortic root and ilio-femoral artery size. Methods In 506 patients referred for pre-procedural CT evaluation before TAVI we performed a detailed assessment of aortic root anatomy: size of the annulus and the sinus of Valsalva (SoV), diameter of the sino-tubular junction (STJ), and distance of the coronary artery ostia to the aortic annulus plane; we also determined the dimensions of aorta, subclavian, and ilio-femoral arteries. Results Women had significantly smaller aortic root dimensions (annulus mean diameter: 22.9 ± 2.2 mm vs. 25.7 ± 2.7 mm, SoV mean diameter: 31.8 ± 4.2 mm vs. 36.3 ± 3.8 mm, STJ mean diameter: 26.3 ± 3.4 mm vs. 29.8 ± 4.2 mm) and lower left and right coronary artery ostia take-off (12.3 ± 2.4 vs. 14.1 ± 2.9 mm; 14.8 ± 2.6 vs. 17.1 ± 3.2 mm, respectively) than men (P < 0.001 for all), even after adjustment for their smaller body surface area (BSA) and height. Dimensions of the ascending aorta, subclavian and ilio-femoral arteries were also significantly smaller in women, but not when adjusted for BSA. Conclusions Women with severe AS had smaller aortic root dimensions even after correcting for their smaller body size and height, reflecting a sex-specific difference. In contrast, sex-related differences in aortic, subclavian, and ilio-femoral dimensions were fully explained by the smaller BSA of women.

AB  - Rationale: Calcific aortic stenosis (AS) is characterized by calcium deposition in valve leaflets. However, women present lower aortic valve calcification loads than men for the same AS hemodynamic severity. Objective: We, thus, aimed to assess sex differences in aortic valve fibrocalcific remodeling. Methods and Results: One hundred and twenty-five patients underwent Doppler echocardiography and multidetector computed tomography within 3 months before aortic valve replacement. Explanted stenotic tricuspid aortic valves were weighed, and fibrosis degree was determined. Sixty-four men and 39 women were frequency matched for age, body mass index, hypertension, renal disease, diabetes mellitus, and AS severity. Mean age (75±9 years), mean gradient (41±18 mm Hg), and indexed aortic valve area (0.41±0.12 cm2 /m2) were similar between men and women (all P≥0.18). Median aortic valve calcification (1973 [1124-3490] Agatston units) and mean valve weight (2.36±0.99 g) were lower in women compared with men (both P<0.0001). Aortic valve calcification density correlated better with valve weight in men (r2 =0.57; P<0.0001) than in women (r2 =0.26; P=0.0008). After adjustment for age, body mass index, aortic valve calcification density, and aortic annulus diameter, female sex was an independent risk factor for higher fibrosis score in AS valves (P=0.003). Picrosirius red staining of explanted valves showed greater amount of collagen fibers (P=0.01), and Masson trichrome staining revealed a greater proportion of dense connective tissue (P=0.02) in women compared with men. Conclusions: In this series of patients with tricuspid aortic valve and similar AS severity, women have less valvular calcification but more fibrosis compared with men. These findings suggest that the pathophysiology of AS and thus potential targets for drug development may be different according to sex.

AB  - Background: There is a paucity of data on the sex differences in the prevalence, clinical presentation, and prognosis of aortic stenosis (AS). Methods and Results: A total of 3,815 consecutive patients with severe AS were enrolled in the multicenter CURRENT AS registry between January 2003 and December 2011. The registry included 1,443 men (38%) and 2,372 women (62%). Women were much older than men (79±10 vs. 75±10 years, P<0.0001), and the ratio of women to men increased with age. The cumulative 5-year incidence of all-cause death was significantly higher in men than in women (47% vs. 41%, P=0.003), although women were more symptomatic and much older. The 5-year mortality was similar between men and women at age <65 years (16% vs. 15%, P=0.99), whereas it was significantly higher in men than in women at age ≥65 years (65–74 years, 38% vs. 19%, P<0.0001; 75–84 years, 55% vs. 34%, P<0.0001; ≥85 years: 82% vs. 72%, P=0.03). Conclusions: A large Japanese multicenter registry of consecutive patients with severe AS included a much higher proportion of women than men, with the female:male sex ratio increasing with age. The 5-year mortality rate of women was lower than that of men. Lower 5-year mortality rates in women were consistently seen across all age groups >65 years.

AB  - Introduction: There are inconsistent data on the sex-related differences in clinical outcomes and quality of life (QoL) after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). Aim: We sought to investigate sex-related differences in procedural, clinical and QoL outcomes of TAVI. Material and methods: A total of 101 consecutive patients undergoing TAVI were enrolled. Patients were stratified by gender. Baseline characteristics, procedural and long-term clinical outcomes as well as frailty and QoL indices (EQ-5D-3L questionnaire) were compared between women and men. Results: Women represented 60.4% of the study population. Periprocedural risk measured with the Logistic EuroSCORE and STS scale was similar for women and men. There were no differences in 30-day or 12-month all-cause mortality between groups (women vs. men: 9.8% vs. 12.5%; age-adjusted odds ratio (OR) (95% CI): 1.38 (0.39-4.94); 13.1% vs. 25.0%; age-adjusted OR (95% CI): 2.51 (0.87-7.25)). Men were at higher risk of new onset atrial fibrillation at follow-up (1.6% vs. 17.5%; age-adjusted OR (95% CI): 14.61 (1.68-127.37)). In multivariable Cox regression analysis, a history of stroke/transient ischemic attack (TIA) (hazard ratio (HR)) (95% CI): 3.93 (1.39-11.07) and blood transfusion (HR (95% CI): 2.84 (1.06-7.63)) were identified as independent factors affecting 12-month mortality. No differences in QoL parameters were noted. Conclusions: The TAVI can be considered as an effective and safe treatment in high-risk patients with severe aortic stenosis, regardless of gender.

AU  - Loquias, M.
T2  - Heart Lung and Circulation
AB  - Background: Females exhibit differences in morphologic, haemodynamic and ventricular response to progressive AS. Sex specific management strategy for patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis (AS) undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) remains undetermined. Objectives: We sought to examine the sex related 30-day and 6-months outcomes following transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Methods: This is a retrospective cohort of women and men undergoing TAVR from February 2012 to November 2016. The primary outcome measure of this research is the sex-specific differences in the safety endpoint at 30-days and 6 months (composite of mortality, stroke, major vascular complication, life threatening bleeding). Secondary outcome measures degree of post procedural paravalvular leak and aortic regur-gitation. Results: 89 patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis were enrolled in the study between February 2012 and December 2016. 43.8% were female. There were only 2 male patients who had major vascular complications and life threatening bleeding. There was no statical difference in stroke complications in both sexes. 30-day postoperatively, 4 females (10.3%) and 5 (10%) male patients expired from non-cardiovascular related events. The 6-months all-cause mortality is 4.8% (F = 1.2% vs M = 3.6%). No major vascular complication, life threatening bleeding and stroke across the cohort group. There were no moderate paravalvular leaks noted in female and male cohort groups, respectively, after 6 months. Conclusions: Female patients who underwent TAVR had comparable results with male patients in 30-day and 6-month all-cause mortality. TAVR is feasible, safe and equally effective in both sexes.

TI  - Gender Disparities Across the Spectrum of Advanced Cardiac Therapies: Real or Imagined?
AU  - Bogaev, R.C.
T2  - Current Cardiology Reports
AB  - Cardiovascular disease has been responsible for more deaths in women than in men each year since 1985. This review discusses federal laws that have influenced the inclusion of women in research and reporting sex-specific differences, then addresses gender differences and gender disparities in four areas of clinical cardiovascular medicine: coronary heart disease, valvular heart disease, electrophysiology, and heart failure. The prevalence of disease in women is highlighted, the clinical characteristics of women at the time of referral for advanced therapies are reviewed, and the clinical outcomes of women are discussed. With the emergence of new technology such as smaller devices and less invasive procedures, more women are being referred for advanced therapies. However, a gap in awareness and diagnosis remains, contributing to later referrals for women. Women who do undergo advanced therapies often have more comorbidities and worse outcomes than men. A call is made to increase awareness, educate healthcare providers, and report more sex-specific data to resolve these gender disparities.

AB  - BACKGROUND A survival benefit following transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) was observed in females as compared to males in inoperable and high-risk patients receiving early generation balloon expandable valves. Whether sex specific outcomes benefit persists in lower risk patients treated with the SAPIEN 3 (S3) valve is unknown. METHODS The PARTNER 2 S3 trial included high risk (S3HR; STS risk score > 8 or heart team determination) and intermediate risk (S3IR; STS risk score 4-8 or heart team determination) patients with severe symptomatic AS for TAVR who were treated with the S3 valve (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA). Patient characteristics and clinical outcomes at 30 days and 1 year were compared by sex. RESULTS Between 10/2013 and 12/2014, 1661 patients were enrolled: HR, 583 (338 male; 245 female) and IR, 1078 (666 male; 412 female). In both cohorts, females were more likely than males to be frail (22% vs. 13%; p<0.001) but less likely to have diabetes, renal insufficiency, CAD, α-fib, or COPD. Females were more likely to receive ±23mm valves (74.1% vs. 11.1%; p<0.001) and less likely to receive 29mm valves (1.4% vs. 35.1%; p<0.001). In the combined cohorts, female-sex was not associated with decreased mortality at 30-days (combined: 2.0% vs. 1.2%; HR 1.67 [0.76, 3.65];p=0.20) or 1-year (combined: 9.3% vs. 10.2%; HR 0.9 [0.7, 1.3]; p=0.59). Female-sex was associated with increased major vascular complications (combined: 7.9% vs. 4.4%; HR 1.8 [1.2, 2.7]; p=0.003) but there was no association with ≥moderate PVR. Upon independent analysis of HR and IR cohorts, similar outcomes in both sexes were obtained (Table). CONCLUSION Contrary to previously published outcomes with earlier generation valves, no sex-specific differences in survival or stroke following TAVR were identified in intermediate and high-risk patients with the S3 valve. (Table Presented).

AB  - BACKGROUND Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is an alternative to surgical valve replacement in high risk patients with severe aortic stenosis. However, it is unclear whether women and men benefit equally from this therapy. The aim of this analysis was to study gender differences in 30-day, one and two year outcome following undergoing TAVR. METHODS High risk and inoperable patients with severe aortic stenosis in which TAVR was performed were considered feasible by the Heart Team, consisting of at least one TAVR-experienced interventional cardiologist and one cardiac surgeon, were included into the analysis. All primary endpoint-related events were fully adjudicated according to the Valve Academic Research Consortium 2 definitions. RESULTS Between January 2006 and 2015, a total of 2004 patients (logEUROScore 19.4±13.3%, STS Score 8.3±6.1%) with severe aortic stenosis were treated with a variety of TAVR device at our institution and included in the analysis. Gender distribution was unequal throughout the study population with 56% of the patients being female (N=1128) and 44% male (N=876). Women and men did not differ with regard to the occurrence of porcelain aorta (2.0 vs. 2.8 %) and pulmonary hypertension (37.1 vs. 34.0%). In contrast, cerebrovascular disease (12.5 vs. 17.6 %) and coronary artery disease were less prevalent in women (35.2 vs. 57.3%, p<0.05). Additionally women had less often undergone previous CABG (5.0 vs. 22.5%, p<0.05). Moreover, female patients were significantly older (81.2±5.4 vs. 79.2±6.3 years, p<0.05), were more often diabetic (46.0 vs. 30.6%, p<0.05), had a lower logEUROScore (18.8±12.0 vs. 20.2±14.7, p<0.05), but a higher STS Score (9.0±6.2 vs. 7.4±5.8, p<0.05) as well as had higher peak (73±25 vs. 66±22 mmHg, p<0.05) and mean aortic valve gradient (46±17 vs. 42±15 mmHg, p<0.05). LVEF was reduced in male patients (50.7±14.8 vs. 57.9±13.1 %, p<0.05). TAVR effectively increased the aortic valve orifice area accompanied by a decline in mean aortic valve gradient in both men and women. The occurrence of VARC kidney injury (14.5 % in women vs. 15.8 % in men) and of access site complications (20.1 % in women vs. 19.8 % in men) did not differ, respectively. However, female patients had a significantly higher rate of any bleeding complications (41.0% in women vs. 33.2%) and neurologic events (5.9% in women vs. 2.9 %, all p<0.05). At 30 days, there was no significant difference in all-cause mortality (7.4% in women vs. 6.7% in men). After one and two years of follow-up mortality was higher for male patients but did not reach statistical significance in a multivariate analysis (one year: 18.4% vs. 22.9% in men; two year 22.9 vs. 27.6% in men). CONCLUSION This analysis demonstrates that women and men treated with TAVR differ with regard to several risk factors, as for example age, LVEF, coronary artery disease and previous bypass surgery. Women are more likely to experience bleeding complications and neurologic events after TAVR; however this does not result in a worse outcome for women as compared to men.

AB  - Background-Sex-related differences in morbidity and survival in bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) adults are fundamentally unknown. Contemporary studies portend excellent survival for BAV patients identified at early echocardiographic-clinical stages. Whether BAV adults incur a survival disadvantage throughout subsequent echocardiographic-clinical stages remains undetermined. Methods and Results-Analysis was done of 3 different cohorts of consecutive patients with echocardiographic diagnosis of BAV identified retrospectively: (1) a community cohort of 416 patients with first BAV diagnosis (age 35±21 years, follow-up 16±7 years), (2) a tertiary clinical referral cohort of 2824 BAV adults (age 51±16 years, follow-up 9±6 years), and (3) a surgical referral cohort of 2242 BAV adults referred for aortic valve replacement (AVR) (age 62±14 years, follow-up 6±5 years). For the community cohort, 20-year risks of aortic regurgitation (AR), AVR, and infective endocarditis were higher in men (all P=0.04); for a total BAV-related morbidity risk of 52±4% vs 35±6% in women (P=0.01). The cohort's 25-year survival was identical to that in the general population (P=0.98). AR independently predicted mortality in women (P=0.001). Baseline AR was more common in men (P=0.02) in the tertiary cohort, with 20-year survival lower than that in the general population (P<0.0001); age-adjusted relative death risk was 1.16 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.05-1.29) for men versus 1.67 (95% CI 1.38-2.03) for women (P=0.001). AR independently predicted mortality in women (P=0.01). Baseline AR and infective endocarditis were higher in men (both =0.001) for the surgical referral cohort, with 15-year survival lower than that in the general population (P<0.0001); age-adjusted relative death risk was 1.34 (95% CI 1.22-1.47) for men versus 1.63 (95% CI 1.40-1.89) for women (P=0.026). AR and NYHA class independently predicted mortality in women (both P≤0.04). Conclusions-Within evolving echocardiographic-clinical stages, the long-term survival of adults with BAV is not benign, as both men and women incur excess mortality. Although BAV-related morbidity is higher in men in the community, and AR and infective endocarditis are more prevalent in men, women exhibit a significantly higher relative risk of death in tertiary and surgical referral cohorts, which is independently associated with AR.

AB  - Purpose: Although studies have suggested that non-syndromic female infants with congenital heart disease (CHD) have higher mortality than males, it is unclear whether this association is cardiac lesion-specific. Given that Turner syndrome (TS) - which is limited to and variable in females - is strongly associated with left-sided CHD and is also associated with high mortality in infancy, we hypothesized that the sex differences in mortality described in the literature could be associated with unrecognized abnormalities of the X chromosome. The two aims of this study were 1) to evaluate the association between sex and inpatient mortality by CHD lesion among infants with CHD in the absence of other reported extra-cardiac birth defects or genetic disorders, and 2) to estimate the difference between the reported and true prevalence of TS in a specific left-sided lesion (LSL), hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS). Methods: Using the Texas Inpatient Public Use Data File, a Texas administrative database including >37.9 million hospitalizations between January 1999 through June 2012, 138,935 infants with CHD and no extracardiac birth defects or genetic disorders were identified. Mixed regression models were used to evaluate the association between sex and mortality by lesion, while controlling for hospital, race/ethnicity, age at discharge, poverty, preterm gestation, and low birth weight. We then estimated the difference between the reported and true prevalence of TS in HLHS by comparing reported Texas population-based birth defect registry data to a hospital-based cohort of infants born from 2009-2016 with HLHS who underwent systematic genetic evaluation for TS by chromosomal microarray. Results: Overall, there was no significant difference in mortality between sexes (OR for female 0.94, 95% CI 0.88- 1.00). However, significantly increased female mortality was observed in hospitalizations with LSLs: bicuspid aortic valve (n=1918, adjusted OR 1.86, 95% CI 1.12-3.12), coarctation of the aorta (n=3789, adjusted OR 1.44, 95% CI 1.10-1.90), aortic stenosis/aortic insufficiency (n=3102, adjusted OR 1.41, 95% CI 1.05-1.90), HLHS (n=2828, adjusted OR 1.27, 95% CI 1.02-1.59). The increased female mortality was not seen in right heart lesions (n=8686, OR for female 1.03, 95% CI 0.72-1.48). In the hospital-based HLHS cohort (n=148, including 65 females) for which 95% of females underwent testing, the prevalence of TS in females with HLHS was 9.2%, which was greater than the population-reported female prevalence in HLHS of 3.3-5.3%. Conclusion: Female sex is associated with increased hospital mortality among infants with LSLs. Hospital-wide evaluation of a subset of LSLs, HLHS, suggests that TS is much more prevalent than documented in a similar infant population. Given the strong association between TS and LSLs, and the high infant mortality associated with TS, unrecognized TS may explain some of the increased female mortality in CHD.

AB  - Background: The aim of this observational, single-center study was to evaluate the impact of gender on surgical outcome in patients with active infective endocarditis (AIE) of the aortic valve. Material/Methods: Between October 1994 and January 2011, 755 patients (558 men and 297 women) underwent surgery for AIE at the Leipzig Heart Center, Germany, according to the modified Duke criteria. Data were collected before surgery and as the study was ongoing. Gender influence on survival was evaluated (Kaplan-Meier curves). Cox proportional models were used to evaluate gender differences in relation to early mortality (within 30 days) and late mortality (up to 10 years). Results: The early mortality rate was 15.0% among men and 23.0% among women, which was statistically significant different (p=0.01). In male patients, variables associated with overall mortality were age (HR 1.63, 95% CI 1.43–1.86; p<0.001), insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (HR 2.02, 95% CI 1.48–2.75; p<0.001), preoperative low ejection fraction (OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.98–0.99; p=0.002), previous cardiac surgery (OR 1.62, 95% CI 1.22–2.13; p=0.001), preoperative ventilation (OR 1.77, 95% CI 1.14–2.75; p=0.012), preoperative dialysis (OR 1.89, 95% CI 1.20–2.98; p=0.006), NYHA Class IV (OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.12–2.15; p=0.008), and involvement of multiple valves (OR 1.65, 95% CI 1.24–2.19; p=0.001) had a statistically significant influence on the late mortality. Focus identification (OR 1.75, 95% CI 1.08–2.77; p=0.023), involvement of multiple valves (OR 1.52, 95% CI 1.02–2.26; p=0.040), preoperative dialysis (OR 3.65, 95% CI 1.96–6.77; p<0.001), and age (OR 1.53, 95% CI 1.28–1.82; p<0.004) were predictive risk factors for late mortality in women with AIE (OR 3.6, 95% CI 1.5–8.4; p<0.004). Conclusions: This study demonstrated distinct gender-based differences in risk of mortality in patients with AIE (who were undergoing surgical treatment) with different early and long-term outcomes.

AB  - Introduction Aortic stenosis (AS) results in left ventricular hypertrophy, myocyte dysfunction and fibrosis as a physiological response to excessive afterload. Transcatheter Aortic Valve implantation (TAVI) is an effective treatment for severe AS, however controversy exists whether gender predisposes to improved myocardial function post procedure. Feature-tracking cardiovascular magnetic resonance (FT-CMR) is a novel method for quantification of myocardial strain and strain rate that can identify subtle changes in left ventricular (LV) mechanics prior to overt changes in LV ejection fraction (EF). Our aim was to compare the acute impact of TAVI on LV function between males and females defined by strain measurements. Methods 59 patients, 34 males and 25 females matched for age (78.4 ± 7.19 years vs 78.8 ± 9.7 years p = 0.876), EuroSCORE II (5.19 ± 4.33% vs 4.26 ± 2.99% p = 0.788) and presence of baseline myocardial fibrosis (p = 0.829) with severe, symptomatic AS were prospectively enrolled prior to TAVI. All patients underwent an identical 1.5T CMR protocol (Intera or Ingenia, Phillips Healthcare, Best, The Netherlands) at baseline and at a median of 4 days following TAVI. Endocardial and epicardial borders were traced manually on the end-diastolic slice, then strain and strain rate measurements were obtained using commercially available post-processing software (CVI42, Circle Cardiovascular Imaging, Calgary, Alberta, Canada). Results TAVI was associated with a significant and comparable reduction in peak aortic pressure gradient and LV mass index in both men and women (Table 1). There was no significant difference in extent of pressure drop (p = 0.374) or extent of regression of LV mass index (p = 0.095) between men and women. There was no significant change in left ventricular end diastolic volume indexed (LVEDVI) or LVEF observed acutely following TAVI, in men or women (Table 1). Longitudinal strain (Ell), circumferential strain (Ecc) and circumferential strain rate (SRcc) did not change significantly in men or women (Table 2). However, TAVI was associated with a significant increase in longitudinal strain rate (SRll) in males (p = 0.012) that was not observed in females (p = 0.184) (Table 2). Conclusion TAVI was associated with structural reverse remodelling that was comparable between males and females. Functional recovery in LV mechanics following TAVI may occur earlier in males than in females, although this may reflect the higher LVMI that men have at baseline prior to TAVI.

AB  - Background Cardiac adaptation to aortic stenosis (AS) appears to differ according to sex, but reverse remodeling after aortic valve replacement has not been extensively described. The aim of the study was to determine using cardiac magnetic resonance imaging whether any sex-related differences exist in AS in terms of left ventricular (LV) remodeling, myocardial fibrosis, and reverse remodeling after valve replacement. Methods One hundred patients (men, n = 60) with severe AS undergoing either transcatheter or surgical aortic valve replacement underwent cardiac magnetic resonance scans at baseline and 6 months after valve replacement. Results Despite similar baseline comorbidity and severity of AS, women had a lower indexed LV mass than did men (65.3 ± 18.4 vs 81.5 ± 21.3 g/m2, P <.001) and a smaller indexed LV end-diastolic volume (87.3 ± 17.5 vs 101.2 ± 28.6 mL/m2, P =.002) with a similar LV ejection fraction (58.6% ± 10.2% vs 54.8% ± 12.9%, P =.178). Total myocardial fibrosis mass was similar between sexes (2.3 ± 4.1 vs 1.3 ± 1.1 g, P =.714), albeit with a differing distribution according to sex. After aortic valve replacement, men had more absolute LV mass regression than did women (18.3 ± 10.6 vs 12.7 ± 8.8 g/m2, P =.007). When expressed as a percentage reduction of baseline indexed LV mass, mass regression was similar between the sexes (men 21.7% ± 10.1% vs women 18.4% ± 11.0%, P =.121). There was no sex-related difference in postprocedural LV ejection fraction or aortic regurgitation. Sex was not found to be a predictor of LV reverse remodeling on multiple regression analysis. Conclusions There are significant differences in the way that male and female hearts adapt to AS. Six months after aortic valve replacement, there are no sex-related differences in reverse remodeling, but superior reverse remodeling in men as a result of their more adverse remodeling profile at baseline.

AB  - Background: Aortic stenosis is a common valvular disease, especially in the aging population of Western countries. While surgical aortic valve replacement is the predominant treatment for patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis, 30% to 40% of patients are not eligible for surgery due to advanced age, severe left ventricular dysfunction, or other comorbidities. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has been shown to be an alternative therapeutic approach for these patients showing better or equal results compared to surgical valve replacement. However, the effects of sex on outcomes after TAVR remain to be elucidated. Objective(s): We gathered and compared all previously reported sex-specific data on effectiveness and safety outcomes after TAVR. Material/Methods: We conducted a search in PUBMED and EMBASE using the following key words: 'transcatheter aortic valve replacement', 'transcatheter aortic valve implantation', 'sex differences', 'gender', 'sex characteristics'. Selected publications consisted of original reports that included sex-specific data on outcomes after TAVR and were written in English. From the publications we collected information on sex-specific baseline features, procedural characteristics and post procedural outcomes after TAVR. We used mortality, valve complications, cerebrovascular complications, vascular complications and other outcomes as our main endpoints. Results: After in- and exclusion criteria were applied, our search resulted in 25 publications. At baseline, men had more comorbidities than women, especially in terms of pre-procedural cardiovascular disease and cardiac interventions. Women were older, had higher aortic valve gradients and a higher ejection fraction. While there were no significant sex-differences in mortality rates at 30 days, most studies reported better survival in women at mid- and long-term follow up with hazard ratios (for women compared to men) ranging from 0.27 (95% CI: 0.09-0.84) to 0.91 (95% CI: 0.75-1.10). Other outcomes included aortic regurgitation, which was the most common valve complication. At 30 days of follow up, aortic regurgitation was more prevalent among men (12%-24%and 7-19% in women and men, respectively). Stroke rates were similar at 30 days (women: 1%-7% and men: 1%-5%). Women also had higher rates of vascular complications at 30 days, ranging from 6%-20% compared to 2%-14% in men and higher bleeding rates ranging from 10%-44% compared to 8%-25% in men. Myocardial infarction was similar between the sexes as well as tamponade, kidney injury/ failure and sepsis. Permanent pacemaker implantation was more frequent among men with rates from 10%-25% in women and 15%-31% in men. Conclusions: In this systematic literature review we found a better survival in women compared to men after TAVR at midand long-term follow up. However, in general women had more vascular complications and bleeding, but less aortic regurgitation and pacemaker implantations; stroke rates were similar between women and men. These findings may partly be explained by better baseline characteristics and less valve mismatch in women compared to men. Results should be interpreted with caution as most measures only include raw percentages. Future studies including a larger sample of patients, preferably based on individual-patient data meta-analysis, are required to confirm and thoroughly evaluate these preliminary findings.

AB  - Background: Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI) is an effective alternative to surgical valve replacement in symptomatic patients with severe aortic stenosis at high or extreme surgical risk, but the impact of sex on outcomes remains unclear. The aim of this study was to examine sex differences in outcome after TAVI. Methods: A total of 500 consecutive patients undergoing TAVI were evaluated. Differences in all-cause mortality were examined and the safety endpoints (vascular complications, stroke, myocardial infarction, acute kidney injury) according to the Valve Academic Research Consortium criteria. Results: 295 patients (59%) were female. The prevalence of comorbidities was higher in men compared with women, including coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic renal failure (55.6% vs. 34.2%, p<0.001, 45.9% vs. 24.1%, p=0.001 and 31.2% vs. 15.3%, p=0.001, respectively). There were not significant differences in complications after TAVI, in-hospital mortality 4.4% for men vs. 3.1% for women, p=0.290, vascular complications 2.9% vs. 6.8%, p=0.056, stroke 3.4% vs. 3.4%,p=0.988. After follow-up of 34.36±23 months, the totalmortality was similar in both sex, 25.9% vs. 21%, p=0.206. Survival at 1, 2, 3, 4 y 5 years were slightly lower in men 87.6% vs. 91.64%, 81.4% vs. 86.4%, 76.9% vs. 81.7%, 70.4% vs. 79.2%, 64.8% vs. 73.5%, log Rank 2.3, p=0.126. There was most total mortality in men 23.2% vs. 15.2%, [OR=1.688 (95% CI 1.04-2.742), p=0.023] and this results persisted for 2 years, [HR=1.576 (1.019-2.438), p=0.042]. Conclusions: Male sex is associated with worse comorbidities, but the results of procedure and long-term survival were similar in both sex.

AB  - Background: Randomized trials suggested higher complications in women undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Single center studies also demonstrated higher morbidity and mortality in women undergoing surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) compared with men. Large-scale outcomes data on women undergoing SAVR is limited. We sought to evaluate contemporary sex-related differences in outcomes in patients undergoing TAVR and SAVR. Methods: The nationwide inpatient sample was used to identify patients>65 year old with severe aortic stenosis who underwent TAVR or SAVR between January-2005 and December-2012. Comparative analysis of in-hospital morbidity and mortality between men and women was performed. Results: 8343 patients (48.3% women) underwent TAVR and 309729 (40.4% women) patients underwent SAVR. Mean age for women was 83.1±6.5 in the TAVR group and 76.8±6.4 in the SAVR group. In comparison with men, women who underwent TAVR had more vascular complications requiring surgery (6.6% vs 4.4%, p<0.01), more blood transfusion (32.5% vs 26.9%, p<0.01), more stroke (2% vs 1.1%, p<0.01), but less acute kidney injury (16.4 vs 21%, p<0.01) and less pacemaker implantation (8.8% vs 10.1%, p=0.04). In-hospital mortality was similar (5.2% vs 4.4%, p=0.1). Women who underwent SAVR also had more vascular complications requiring surgery (3.2% vs 2.8%, p<0.01), more blood transfusion (45.2% vs 40.1%, p<0.01), more stroke (2.2% vs 1.6%, p<0.01), similar rates of pacemaker implantation (6.8% vs 6.8%, p=0.8), and less acute kidney injury (15% vs 18%, p<0.01) than men who underwent SAVR. Following SAVR, women had significantly higher in-hospital death than men (5.2% vs 3.8%, p<0.01). Conclusions: In comparison with men, women have higher rates of major vascular complications, blood transfusion and stroke after both TAVR and SAVR. However, there appears to be an association between sex and in-hospital mortality after SAVR but not after TAVR. These findings have implications for risk stratification of women with severe aortic stenosis before TAVR or SAVR.

AB  - Background: Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is the most common congenital heart disease. The aim of this study is to define the gender differences in prevalence, valve morphology and dysfunction (aortic stenosis [AS]/regurgitation [AR]), aortopathy, dissection and endocarditis in a large cohort of BAV patients from a multicentre registry. Methods: In 1887 patients with BAV, demographic, clinical and echocardiographic data at first presentation were collected. BAV was classified according to Sievers' classification and the aortic dilatation configurations were adopted from Fazel classification. Results: 1347(71.4%) were male and 540 (28.6%) were female. There were no significant gender differences regarding age of diagnosis, cardiovascular risk factors, BAV phenotype, frequency of normal valve function, dissection and endocarditis (Table). More male presented with ≥moderate AR (32.7% vs. 21.9%, p<0.001) whereas more female presented with ≥moderate AS (35.7% vs. 45.2%, p<0.001). In terms of aortopathy, diffuse dilatation of the aorta was more frequently observed in male (Table). Conclusions: Male patients with BAV present more frequently with ≥moderate AR at first presentation whereas female present more frequently with ≥moderate AS. Furthermore, diffuse dilatation of the aorta was more prevalent in male. (Table presented).

AB  - Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has become the standard of care for patients with hemodynamically severe aortic stenosis who are symptomatic but deemed too high risk for surgery. Recent reports suggest that sex differences exist in outcomes following TAVR and in the diagnostic imaging evaluation of patients being considered for TAVR. In this review, the authors explore the differences between men and women in baseline characteristics and outcomes following TAVR, as well as sex differences in the imaging findings of severe aortic stenosis (AS) including the diagnostic challenges in the hemodynamic assessment of severe AS in elderly women, differences in aortic valvular calcification and in the associated myocardial response to severe AS. Additionally, sex differences in imaging findings as they relate to post-TAVR complications including coronary obstruction, annular rupture and prosthesis-patient mismatch are also discussed.

AB  - Introduction: Octogenarians are particularly vulnerable to sleep disturbances in the early postoperative phase after aortic valve therapy, resulting in increased daytime sleep and decreased mobilization. Few studies have focused on gender differences regarding sleep-wake pattern and selfassessed sleep in octogenarians going through aortic valve therapy. Purpose: To investigate gender differences regarding inhospital sleep and wake pattern in the early postoperative phase after aortic valve therapy. Methods: A prospective cohort study of octogenarian patients in a tertiary university hospital. Inclusion criteria were 80+ years, having severe aortic stenosis and accepted for surgical or transcatheter aortic valve therapy. Actigraphy was used to identify the sleep-wake pattern for the first five postoperative nights. Minimal Insomnia Symptom Scale (MISS) and Sleep Sufficient Index (SSI) were used to measure the self-reported insomnia and sleep at baseline and daily for the first five postoperative nights. Results: In the 143 participants (age 83 years, SD 2.7) 57% were women. According to actigraphy, women slept significantly more during both the first (mean 392, SD 79.6 minutes vs mean 334, SD 116 minutes, P=.002) and the fifth postoperative night (mean 366, SD 102 minutes vs mean 316, SD 135.6 minutes, P=.036) than men. Moreover, women had more daytime sleep than men the first (mean 655, SD 170.7 minutes vs mean 646, SD 148.8 minutes, P=.001) and the fourth postoperative day (mean 514, SD 161 minutes vs mean 505, SD 163 minutes, P=.001). For self-reported sleep, women reported less sleep than men, but there were no significant differences. The most dominant insomnia symptom among women the first night was problems maintaining sleep and the fifth night they had problems initiating sleep. Conclusion: There are gender differences regarding sleepwake pattern in octogenarians measured by actigraphy in the early postoperative phase after aortic valve therapy. Women slept more both at night and day, whereas men perceived to sleep more than women.

AB  - Aims Calcific aortic valve stenosis (AS) is purportedly associated with less calcium burden in women than in men. We sought to examine sex-related differences and correlates of surgically excised aortic valve weight (AVW) in pure AS. Methods and results Clinical and echocardiographic characteristics of 888 consecutive patients who underwent aortic valve replacement for severe AS were correlated to AVW, and in 126 patients, AVW was also correlated to computed tomography aortic valve calcium (AVC) score. Women and men had similar indexed valve area (0.42 ± 0.09 vs. 0.42 ± 0.07 cm 2/m2, P = 0.95) and mean systolic gradient (53 ± 15 vs. 52 ± 13 mmHg, P = 0.11), but women had higher New York Heart Association class (2.63 ± 0.70 vs. 2.50 ± 0.70, P = 0.01) and less prevalent coronary artery disease (38 vs. 52%, P < 0.0001). Aortic valve weight was lower in women (1.94 ± 0.88 vs. 3.08 ± 1.32 g, P < 0.0001) even when indexed to body surface area (1.09 ± 0.48 vs. 1.48 ± 0.62 g/m2, P < 0.0001) or left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) area (0.54 ± 0.23 vs. 0.71 ± 0.29 g/cm2, P < 0.0001). Using multivariate analysis, male sex (P < 0.0001), bicuspid valve (P < 0.0001), and larger LVOT area (P < 0.0001) were the major determinants of increased AVW, along with current cigarette smoking (P = 0.007). Diabetes (P = 0.004) and hypertension (P = 0.03) were independently associated with lower AVW. Aortic valve calcium correlated well with AVW (r = 0.81, P < 0.0001) and was lower in women than in men (2520 ± 1199 vs. 3606 ± 1632 arbitrary units, P < 0.0001). Conclusions Despite the same degree of AS severity, women have less AVC and lower AVW compared with men, irrespective of valve morphology. Aortic valve calcium is correlated to excised AVW. Hypertension, diabetes, and current cigarette smoking were independently associated with AVW.

AB  - Background Gender disparities have been established in patients who have atrial fibrillation (AF), and in their outcomes after medical treatment for AF. This study evaluated differences in outcome by gender in patients who underwent surgical treatment for AF. Methods From April 2004 to December 2012, a total of 936 patients had surgical treatment for AF. Outcomes were analyzed by gender using propensity score-matching methods. Results Of the 936 subjects, 571 (61%) were men; women were older (aged 68.6 ± 11.3 vs 66.9 ± 11.9 years; P =.033), had more heart failure (44% vs 37%; P =.024), more mitral valve surgery (72% vs 50%; P <.001) and more tricuspid valve surgery (41% vs 18%; P <.001). Men underwent more coronary artery bypass surgery (37% vs 19%; P <.001) and aortic valve surgery (38% vs 31%; P =.029). Women had higher late stroke rate per 10 person-years (0.15 vs 0.07; P =.035), fewer catheter ablations (6.0% vs 9.8%; P =.017), and a trend toward fewer cardioversions for recurrent AF (15.7% vs 19.2%; P =.20). After propensity-score matching, late stroke rates per 10 person-years trended higher in women (0.12 vs 0.04; P =.13). No significant gender differences were found in overall survival (5-year survival: 78.8% in men, and 81.0% in women; P =.40) or freedom from AF without antiarrhythmic drugs at last follow-up (71.8% in men vs 73.6% in women, P =.59). Conclusions Women sought surgery treatment at older ages and with more heart failure. No gender-based differences were found in stroke, overall survival, or procedure success, after propensity-score matching.

AB  - Aortic stenosis is the commonest valve defect in the developed world and is associated with a high mortality once symptomatic. There is a difference in the way that male and female hearts remodel in the face of chronic pressure overload: women develop a concentrically hypertrophied, small cavity left ventricle (LV), whereas men are more prone to the development of eccentric hypertrophy. At a cellular level, there is an increase in collagen and metalloproteinase gene expression in males suggesting a different regulation of extracellular volume composition according to sex. Male hearts with aortic stenosis appear to have more fibrosis than their female comparators. The trigger for this appears to be in part related to estrogen receptor signaling, but other factors such as renin-angiotensin activation, nitric oxide, and circulating noradrenaline levels may also be implicated. Treatment options include surgical valve replacement (SAVR) and more recently transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Female sex may be a risk factor for adverse outcome following SAVR and conversely appears to confer a survival advantage when undergoing TAVR. Whether the lower mortality seen following TAVR in women compared with men (despite their increased age and frailty) reflects their longer life expectancy, smaller annular size (and less post-TAVR aortic regurgitation), more favorable LV reverse remodeling, or more likely, a combination of these factors remains to be established.

AB  - Background: Previous studies have suggested higher rates of mortality among female patients undergoing surgical aortic valve replacement, but gender disparities in transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) patients are not well-studied. Objectives: We sought to compare 30-day and 1-year outcomes in female vs. male patients undergoing TAVR for severe, symptomatic AS. Methods: Consecutive patients undergoing TAVR at a single center were stratified according to gender. We compared female v. male patients in regards to the incidence of comorbidities, in addition to 30-day and 1-year outcomes according to the Valve Academic Research Consortium (VARC) criteria. A Cox proportional hazards regression was performed to assess for an independent association of female gender and mortality at 1 year. Results: The study population included 362 female and 354 male patients. Females were less likely to suffer from a number of comorbidities than males, including a coronary artery disease (63.8% v. 84.3%, p<0.001), peripheral vascular disease (26.3% v. 41.8%, p<0.001), and chronic renal insufficiency (41.7% v. 53.6%, p=0.002). Despite this, females had a higher average STS score (9.9 v. 8.2; p<0.001). Females were more likely to have a life-threatening bleed (9.9% vs. 5.4%, p=0.03), although there was only a trend for more major vascular complications (11.8% vs. 8.2%, p=0.11). Females also had higher rates of in-hospital (7.8% vs. 3.7%, p=0.02) and 30-day mortality (9.7% vs. 5.6%, p=0.04), although there was no difference at 1 year (21.0% vs. 21.5%, p=0.88). Following multivariable adjustment, there was no independent association of gender and mortality at 1 year. Conclusions: Females undergoing TAVR suffer higher rates of short-term mortality, but outcomes at 1 year are similar to males. This suggests that there may be a hazard to female gender periprocedurally, but long term this difference is abolished because of a lesser burden of comorbidities.

AB  - BACKGROUND There is limited data, especially from the US, on sex-related differences with regards to patient characteristics and outcomes with the CoreValve prosthesis. The objective of this study is to compare the baseline characteristics and clinical outcomes in women and men undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement with the CoreValve prosthesis in the United States. METHODS Patients used for this analysis include all patients who underwent TAVR in any one of the 4 CoreValve US trials- the CoreValve Pivotal extreme and high risk trials as well as the CoreValve Continued Access extreme and high risk trials. Data from 3687 patients including 1708 women and 1979 men undergoing TAVR were included for analysis. RESULTS Women comprised 46% of the final cohort and at baseline had a higher STS score (9.6% vs. 8.3%). While there was no difference in baseline NYHA classification, women tended to have fewer cardiac comorbidities and a lower rate of coronary artery disease including fewer MIs, CABGs, and PCIs. Women were also less likely to have peripheral vascular disease, a pre-existing pacemaker, or a prior stroke. Conversely, women had increased frailty indices as measured by KATZ ADL deficits, walk times, and grip strength. At baseline women had a higher mean gradient across the aortic valve (51.5 vs 44.3mmHg) and smaller EOA (0.66 vs. 0.79cm2). From a procedural standpoint, women were slightly more likely to require alternative access (21% vs 18.35%) and tended to receive smaller sized valves. The 30-day and 1-year outcomes are summarized in the table below. CONCLUSIONS Women, who account for nearly half of the population undergoing TAVR within the CoreValve US trials, tend to have fewer cardiac comorbidities and increased frailty as compared to men. While differences exist in procedural risks between men and women undergoing TAVR with the CoreValve prosthesis, there was no difference in 30-day or 1-year mortality. (Table Presented).

AB  - Background: Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV), the most common congenital heart defect, affects men more than women, but long-term assessment of gender-specific outcomes is lacking. Purpose: To determine gender-specific outcome differences in BAV adults within a community cohort, and verify gender-patterns of morbidity and mortality in large tertiary-referral groups. Methods: Retrospective analysis of long-term outcomes in a community-cohort of 416 patients diagnosed with BAV from 1980 to 1999 (age 35±21 years, followup 16±7 years), and in a tertiary-referral cohort of 2824 adult patients diagnosed with BAV from 1990 to 2011 (age 51±16 years, follow-up 9±6 years). Crosssectional analysis of a third group of 2242 adult BAV patients referred for aortic valve replacement from 1995 to 2010 (age 62±14 years). Results: Community-cohort analysis showed no gender difference in 25-year survival (p=0.41), however, 20-year risk of BAV-related morbidity was higher in men (52±4% versus 35±6%, p=0.01), as was the 20-year risk of developing ≥moderate aortic regurgitation (36±5% versus 14±5%, p=0.01). Overall incidence of infectious endocarditis was 13.94 (95% CI 7.25-26.79) per 10,000 patient-years (age-adjusted relative risk 11.39 [95% CI 4.74- 27.36] compared to the general population, p<0.0001) with 25-year rate of 5±2% for men versus 0% for women (p=0.046). Tertiary-referral group analysis showed no gender difference in 20-year survival (p=0.79), but overall 20-year survival rate was lower than expected compared to the general population (64±2% versus 72%, p<0.0001), with age-adjusted relative death risk of 1.16 (95% CI 1.05-1.29) for men and 1.67 (95% CI 1.38-2.03) for women, p=0.001. Independent predictors of mortality were age ≥50 years and Charlson comorbidity index for both genders (all p<0.009), and ejection fraction for men only (p=0.004). Surgical-referral group supported observed morbidity gender-patterns. Conclusions: The long-term outcome of adults with BAV is not benign as both men and women incur excess mortality. Risk of significant aortic regurgitation and BAV-related complications is higher in men compared to women. Infectious endocarditis incidence is higher in BAV patients compared to the general population, and affects men more frequently. Paradoxically, when compared to the general population, women exhibit higher long-term risk of death than men. These observations warrant due attention from the clinical and research communities.

AB  - Background: Very little data exist on the impact of gender on computed tomography (CT) measurements in patients referred for TAVI. Purpose: To evaluate gender-specific differences in CT measurements of patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) referred for transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). Methods: In our cohort of 442 patients (80±8.5 years), there were 239 women and 203 men with severe AS who underwent 256-slice CT before TAVI. We assessed the impact of gender on aortic annulus cross-sectional area (CSA), perimeter (Perim), Sino-tubular junction (STJ), sinus of valsalva (SOV), ellipticity index (EI), and the distance of left and right coronary artery ostia from the aortic annulus plane. In a subgroup of 73 patients we evaluated the impact of gender on the aortic valve calcification (AVC), which was quantitatively evaluated by CT. Results: Women had significantly smaller CSA (404±73 vs. 506±112 mm2), Perim (71.8±7.6 vs. 80.1±8.6 mm), STJ, (27.3±29.4 mm), and SOV (32.5±3.7 vs. 35.6±4.6 mm) versus men; P<0.001 for all, even after adjustment of the small body surface area in women. The EI was comparable between women and men (1.24±0.12 vs. 1.25±0.12, P=0.7), and the mean left and right coronary artery ostia height were lower in women versus men (12.4±2.7 vs. 13.9±3 mm, P<0.001; 14.8±2.6 vs. 17±3.2 mm, P<0.001). AVC was borderline lower in women versus men (12±6.7 cm3 vs. 14.3±6.8 cm3, P=0.1). Conclusion: In this large severe AS population, women had smaller annulus, shallow SOV and STJ, and lower-lying coronary ostia, even after indexing for their smaller body size. The aortic annulus shape was similar in women and men and the valvular calcification in women had a trend towards lower value compared to men.

AB  - Background High BMI is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and, in contrast, low BMI is associated with worse prognosis in heart failure. The knowledge on BMI and the distribution in different BMI-classes in adults with congenital heart disease (CHD) are limited. Methods and results Data on 2424 adult patients was extracted from the Swedish Registry on Congenital Heart Disease and compared to a reference population (n = 4605). The prevalence of overweight/obesity (BMI ≥ 25) was lower in men with variants of the Fontan procedure, pulmonary atresia (PA)/double outlet right ventricle (DORV) and aortic valve disease (AVD) (Fontan 22.0% and PA/DORV 15.1% vs. 43.0%, p = 0.048 and p < 0.001) (AVD 37.5% vs. 49.3%, p < 0.001). Overt obesity (BMI ≥ 30) was only more common in women with AVD (12.8% vs. 9.0%, p = 0.005). Underweight (BMI < 18.5) was generally more common in men with CHD (complex lesions 4.9% vs. 0.9%, p < 0.001 and simple lesions 3.2% vs. 0.6%, < 0.001). Men with complex lesions were shorter than controls in contrast to females that in general did not differ from controls. Conclusion Higher prevalence of underweight in men with CHD combined with a lower prevalence of overweight/obesity in men with some complex lesions indicates that men with CHD in general has lower BMI compared to controls. In women, only limited differences between those with CHD and the controls were found. The complexity of the CHD had larger impact on height in men. The cause of these gender differences as well as possible significance for prognosis is unknown.

AB  - Background: Aortic stenosis (AS) is the most prevalent valvular heart disease in developed countries and has been extensively studied in the past years. Only a limited number of studies have been conducted to clarify differences between male and female patients with aortic stenosis (AS). The aim of this study was to evaluate gender differences in clinical characteristics and outcome in patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis. Methods: Analysed clinical, demographic, echocardiographic characteristics and outcome in patients with symptomatic aortic stenosis, hospitalized in a single centre, between October 2009 and November 2013. The main outcome measure in this study was all-cause-mortality. Patients with other associated major valvular conditions were excluded. Comparisons between groups were performed with an unpaired Student t test. Categorical variables were compared with a chi-square test and Fisher's test. Survival analysis was based on the Kaplan-Meier method. A value of p<0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: 145 patients with isolated severe aortic stenosis were included, mean age 73,9±8,9 years; 55,2% were female. At presentation, women were older (76,8 years vs 70,3 years; p=0,0001) and presented with smaller valve areas estimated by echocardiography (0,65cm2 vs 0,77cm2; p=0,0001) and smaller end-diastolic left ventricular diameter (53,4mm vs 48,3mm; p=0,003). Bicuspid aortic valve were more frequent in male sex (p=0,026); A-fib was more frequent in female sex (p=0,016). Presence of left ventricular systolic dysfunction (p=0,18), mean transvalvular pressure gradient (p=0,572) and presence of significant coronary lesions were similar in females and males. There was no difference in the frequency of angina, syncope or dyspnea between genders. There were no significant differences between groups for presence of arterial hypertension (p=0,73), diabetes (p=0,56) or hypercholesterolemia (p=0,6). Rates of aortic valve replacement were similar between groups. There was no significant difference in the survival of the patients between the two groups (p=0,478) throughout the follow-up period. There was no difference in the frequency of angina, syncope or dyspnea between genders. Conclusions: In our population of patients with symptomatic isolated severe aortic stenosis, female patients were older, had smaller aortic valvular area and left ventricular diameter. Despite older age and more advanced disease in women, there was no significant difference in overall survival.

AB  - Background: In patients with aortic stenosis (AS), pressure overload induces cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis. Although male sex influences cardiac remodeling and fibrosis in animal models, sex differences in left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy regression after aortic valve replacement (AVR) have not yet been fully studied. Methods: We prospectively performed echocardiography before and 2 weeks, 3 and 6 months after AVR in 47 patients, 28 women and 19 men, undergoing AVR for isolated AS. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was also performed before surgery to assess delayed enhancement (DE) as myocardial fibrosis. Results: Preoperatively, women and men had similar LV ejection fraction (56 and 59%) and mass index (142 and 148g/m2). Postoperatively, there was no difference in effective valvular orifice area index and transvalvular pressure gradient between men and women. Two weeks after operation, LV mass in women quickly regressed to 119 g/m2, while increased LV mass in men still persisted (131g/m2). LV mass in men was gradually decreased (121g/m2) to the same level of women 6 months after operation. Cardiac MRI revealed that DE was more frequently found in men (12, 43%) compared with women (4, 21%, p=0.045). Atrial fibrillation was more frequently appeared in men (13, 68%) compared with women (12, 36%, p=0.028) during hospitalization. Conclusion: Women adapt to pressure regression quickly, while men caught up to women 6 months after operation, resulting in a lower frequency of atrial fibrillation in women. (Figure Presented).

AB  - Background: Gender differences in coronary artery disease (CAD) evolution, and overlap in etiologies of CAD and progressive tricuspid aortic stenosis (trileafletAS), suggest also gender differences during the natural progression of trileafletAS. We aimed to explore those differences in a healthy older cohort newly diagnosed with trileafletAS. Methods and Results: Exploratory clinical-based cohort study of 293 consecutive trileafletAS pts (age 70.9±10.9 yrs., 43.7 % female) without cardiac co-morbidities, identified during initial confirmatory echo diagnosis, followed up for 6.5±3.4 yrs for competing outcomes of heart failure (HF), aortic valve (AV) replacement (AVR), and death. 109 pts received AVR-s, 94 pts developed Incident HF, and 102 died. Compared to men, women showed higher hazard ratio of incident HF [age-adjusted HR=1.9; 95% CI (1.1-3.5)] (competing parametric model for AVR, HF and mortality), especially non-ischemic incident HF, and were less likely to die after receiving AVR . Conclusion: We identified gender differences following the diagnostic and clinical expression of trileafletAS without cardiac comorbidities. Further studies should clarify the pathophysiological mechanisms associated with these differences, address the benefits of gender-specific risk scores for predicting outcomes in this population, and explore the potential benefits of gender specific diagnosis approaches, follow-up, and therapy.

AB  - Background: Previous studies have demonstrated improved short term survival in high risk patients with symptomatic aortic stenosis (AS) undergoing trans-catheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) when compared to surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR). However, gender specific outcomes in these patients are not clearly defined. This study sought to examine these outcomes after SAVR or TAVR. Methods: We retrospectively evaluated 200 consecutive patients undergoing aortic valve replacement at our institution between 2002 and 2012. In all, 100 patients undergoing TAVR were matched on their propensity scores with 100 patients undergoing SAVR. Baseline characteristics, 30 day major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), defined as composite end point of stroke, myocardial infarction, cardiovascular death or re-hospitalization, and 1 year all-cause mortality were compared among males and females. Results: All patients undergoing TAVR had significantly lower mortality rate at 12 month when compared to those undergoing SAVR (15% vs. 29%, HR 0.47, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.26 to 0.84, p = 0.01). When compared to male patients, the female patients were predominantly older (82±6 vs 79±8 years), had lower prevalence of prior coronary artery bypass surgery (11% vs. 42%), peripheral artery disease (19% vs. 31%) and lower pre-operative creatinine levels (1.2 vs. 1.5 mg/dl). STS score was similar between both genders (10.7 and 10.8). Among women, the 30-day MACE events and 1 year all-cause mortality was significantly lower in the TAVR group (30% vs 67%, p < 0.001 and 12% vs. 31%, p = 0.002, respectively). Among men, although the 30 day MACE event was significantly lower in TAVR group (12% vs. 31%, p = 0.01), there was no significant survival benefit at 1 year (18% vs. 26%, p = 0.19). Conclusion: In this retrospective propensity score matched analysis, patients undergoing TAVR has persistently improved survival at 1 year when compared to those treated with SAVR. Gender specific analysis showed that female, but not male, patients undergoing TAVR appeared to derive the greatest benefit. More large scale randomized studies are needed to further evaluate this gender difference.

AB  - Background: Left ventricular (LV) remodelling in the setting of the chronic pressure overload of aortic stenosis (AS) appears to differ according to gender. Women appear to have an improved survival compared to men following transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) but the reasons for this are yet to be established. Potential mechanisms include differing patterns of LV reverse remodelling, LV fibrosis regression and reduced aortic regurgitation in females. We sought to establish using cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging, the reference standard non-invasive technique for LV mass and scar quantification, whether there were any gender differences in these parameters before and after TAVI. Methods: 53 patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis undergoing TAVI were prospectively enrolled between April 2009 and March 2014. Patients with contraindications to CMR were excluded and all patients provided informed written consent. All patients underwent an identical 1.5T CMR protocol (Intera, Philips) prior to and at a median of 6 months following TAVI (IQR 5-6 months). Multi slice, multiphase imaging was carried out using a standard steady-state free procession pulse sequence in the short axis to cover the entire left ventricle. Late gadolinium enhancement imaging was performed 10min after the administration of 0.2mmol/kg of gadoteric acid (Doteram, Guerbet, Villepinte). Quantitative analysis was performed using dedicated computer software (CVI42, Circle Cardiovascular Imaging, Alberta, Canada). Results: Basic clinical, echocardiographic and procedural characteristics can be seen in Table 1. Women with severe AS have a smaller indexed LV mass (LVMi) (69.6 ± 18.8g/m2 Vs 81.8 ± 21.6g/m2,p=0.03) less baseline myocardial scar (1.7±2.5g Vs 5.0 ± 5.7g, p=0.01) and a smaller indexed LV end diastolic volume (LVEDVi) than men (90.2 ± 17ml/m2 Vs. 105 ± 27.7 ml/m2;p=0.03). A trend towards a smaller indexed left atrial volume (LAVi) (63.7 ± 17.2ml/m2 Vs 74.2 ± 23.5ml/m2, p=0.08) and better ejection fraction (57.9 ± 11.4% Vs 52.6 ± 13.8%, p=0.15) was also seen in women when compared with men. Six months following TAVI, there was no significant difference seen between genders with regards to LV mass regression, change in ejection fraction, change in myocardial scar burden, change in left atrial volume or change in aortic regurgitant fraction (Table 2). Conclusions: In the setting of the chronic pressure overload of aortic stenosis, there appears to be a difference in LV remodelling between genders with a smaller LV cavity, less fibrosis and a lower LV mass in women compared with men. Six months following TAVI, there did not appear to be a significant difference in LV reverse remodelling, change in myocardial scar burden or aortic regurgitant fraction according to gender.

AB  - Background The effect of gender on patients with aortic stenosis undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) remains to be defined. Methods MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, and Scopus databases were searched for articles describing sex differences in baseline characteristics, procedures, and outcomes. All-cause death at follow-up of at least 1 year was the primary end point, and the independent effect of female gender was evaluated with pooled analysis using a random-effect model and with meta-regression. Results Six studies with 6,645 patients were included, half of them being women presenting with lower European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation (EuroSCORE) compared with men. At 30 days, more frequent major vascular complications and major and life-threatening bleeding occurred in women, with lower rates of moderate to severe aortic regurgitation, whereas 30-day mortality was similar. After a median follow-up of 365 days (range, 365 to 730 days) all-cause mortality was 24.0% in women and 34.0% in men. A pooled analysis of the multivariable approach found female gender was significantly related to a lower risk of death (odds ratio, 0.82; 95% CI, confidence interval, 0.73 to 0.93; I2 = 0%). A meta-regression analysis showed age, ejection fraction, previous cardiovascular accident, renal insufficiency, and access site did not influence these data. Conclusions Female patients undergoing TAVI present with a lower burden of comorbidities. The counterbalance between higher rates of vascular complications but lower of valve regurgitation may explain the reduced risk for women after TAVI, independently from baseline features and access site.

AB  - Objectives The mortality from diastolic dysfunction is approximately 9% to 28%. In patients with ischemic heart disease, female sex and advanced age are associated with increases in ventricular diastolic stiffness. Clinical studies have found higher rates of diastolic dysfunction in women, despite higher ejection fractions, than in men post-myocardial infarction. Therefore, we hypothesized that female patients undergoing cardiac surgery have higher degrees of diastolic dysfunction and experience more adverse outcomes, such as prolonged hospitalization. Methods We prospectively enrolled 153 patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Diastolic function was assessed using early transmitral velocity (E) and early diastolic lateral mitral annular tissue velocity (e'). Left ventricular diastolic dysfunction was defined as binary and a continuous outcome (E/e'). Results Females were more likely than males to present with higher E/e' (11.5 vs. 7.9, p-=-0.001) and higher left ventricular diastolic dysfunction (71% vs. 36%, p-<-0.001). The addition of sex to the model for left ventricular diastolic dysfunction was significant. The relationship between sex and E/e' ratio showed the biggest difference between males and females in the 56-72-year-old age brackets, where women were much more likely to have a higher E/e' than males. Conclusions We identified a significantly higher prevalence of diastolic dysfunction among females presenting for elective cardiac surgery compared to males. This finding is more pronounced with age. Additionally, we found that female sex is at higher risk of prolonged ICU and hospital length of stay. doi: 10.1111/jocs.12506 (J Card Surg 2015;30:238-245)

AB  - Knowledge regarding gender-specific results of percutaneous edge-to-edge mitral valve repair is scarce. The aim of this study was to investigate gender differences in outcomes in a cohort of patients treated with MitraClip implantation. A multicenter registry of 173 patients treated with MitraClip prostheses from 2009 to 2012 at 3 experienced centers was performed. One hundred nine patients (63%) were men. Men were younger (mean age 73 ± 10 vs 79 ± 9 years, p = 0.001) and had a higher prevalence of previous coronary bypass graft surgery (34% vs 13%, p = 0.002), previous myocardial infarction (46% vs 20%, p = 0.001), and diabetes mellitus (26% vs 11%, p = 0.020). There were no differences regarding New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class before the intervention (NYHA class III or IV in 95% of men vs 97% of women, p = 0.472) or the cause of mitral regurgitation (MR) (functional in 58% of men vs 48% of women, p = 0.233). Men exhibited significantly larger ventricles (mean indexed left ventricular end-systolic diameter 2.4 ± 0.8 vs 2.0 ± 1.6 cm/m2, p = 0.002, and mean indexed left ventricular end-diastolic volume 92.7 ± 46.1 vs 59.9 ± 24.6 ml/m2, p <0.001). At 1 month, there were no differences between groups in the reduction of MR or NYHA functional class (MR grade ≤2+ in 98.2% of men vs 96.8% of women, p = 0.586, and NYHA class ≤II in 78.3% of men vs 77% of women, p = 0.851). At 6 months, results were maintained (MR grade ≤2+ in 89.5% of men vs 96.8% of women, p = 0.414, and NYHA class ≤II in 73.1% of men vs 74.2% of women, p = 0.912). After a mean follow-up period of 16.1 ± 11.1 months, no difference was found between groups in the incidence of death or admission for heart failure (log-rank p = 0.798). In conclusion, MitraClip implantation seems to be an equally safe and effective treatment of MR in men and women.

AB  - Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is an established technique for the treatment of severe symptomatic aortic stenosis. Data on long-term TAVI outcomes, both hemodynamic and clinical, in real-world practice settings are limited. We aim to explore the long-term clinical results in patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis using multiple catheter-based options: 360 TAVI-treated patients were followed up for ≤5 years. The Medtronic CoreValve was used in 71% and the Edwards SAPIEN in 26%. The primary end point was all-cause mortality during follow-up. Outcomes were assessed based on the Valve Academic Research Consortium 2 criteria. The mean ± SD patient age was 82.1 ± 6.9 years (56.4% women). The Society of Thoracic Surgeons score was 7.5 ± 4.7. The clinical efficacy end point and time-related valve safety at 3 years was 50% and 81.7%, respectively. The calculated 3- and 5-year survival rates were 71.6% and 56.4%, respectively. Five-year follow-up data were obtained for 54 patients alive; 96.2% of alive patients were in the New York Heart Association class I and II, 4 years after TAVI. No gender differences in all-cause mortality rates were observed (p = 0.58). In multivariate analysis, hospitalization 6 months previous to TAVI (hazard ratio [HR] 1.92, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.17 to 3.15, p = 0.01), frailty (HR 1.89, 95% CI 1.11 to 3.2, p = 0.02), acute kidney injury (HR 1.93, 95% CI 1.03 to 3.61, p = 0.04), and moderate or more paravalvular aortic regurgitation after TAVI (HR 4.26, 95% CI 2.54 to 7.15, p <0.001) were independent predictors for all-cause mortality. In conclusion, long-term outcomes of TAVI are encouraging. Prevention and early identification of paravalvular leak and acute renal failure after the procedure would improve short- and long-term outcomes.

AB  - Aim: The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether women undergoing cardiac surgery are more likely to suffer postoperative complications and mortality than men with respect to baseline and procedural characteristics. Methods: Data of 4030 adult patients undergoing cardiac surgery between January 2007 and June 2012 were retrospectively analyzed; 3075 isolated CABGs (CABG-group) and 955 aortic valve replacements (AVR) whether or not in combination with CABG (VALVE-group) The total study population, had a mean age 69.6 ±10.3 years, and there were 1073/4030 women (26.6%). Results. Female patients were older (P=0.001), at higher EuroSCORE risk (P=0.001) and have a higher BMI (P=0.001). In the CABG-group female patients receive fewer distal anastomoses (P=0.001) and arterial grafts were less frequently used (P=0.002). In the combined procedures in women less distal anastomoses were applied (P=0.029). Postoperative female CABG patients have a higher hospital mortality (P=0.031) and early mortality (P=0.019). In the VALVE group there is no difference in hospital or early mortality between both genders. Binary logistic regression did not identify female gender as an independent risk factor for hospital-or early mortality in both patient groups. Conclusion: Although female patients undergoing cardiac surgery are older and at higher risk, female gender is not an independent risk factor. The operative procedure and gender related differences in treatment may be important and affect the outcome.

AU  - Hahn, R.T.
T2  - Interventional Cardiology
AB  - Females exhibit differences in morphologic, hemodynamic and ventricular response to progressive aortic stenosis (AS), with better overall survival rates compared with males. In addition, females and males differ in baseline characteristics at the time of intervention for symptomatic severe AS. Females have a higher risk of death with surgical aortic valve replacement compared with males. Despite higher incidences of vascular complications, major bleeding and possibly strokes with transcatheter aortic valve replacement, females had better intermediate and long-term mortality compared with males. This review will summarize the data on sex differences in AS and transcatheter aortic valve replacement outcomes.

AB  - Background Sex differences exist in pathogenesis, clinical presentation, and outcome in aortic stenosis (AS). However, only limited information is available concerning sex differences in transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). The aim of the present study is a comprehensive meta-analysis of studies that investigate differences between men and women in outcome after TAVI.
Methods We screened PUBMED, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Inclusion criteria were: AS treated with all forms of TAVI, studies specifically targeting sex/gender differences, and at least 2 of the following outcome data: 30-day all-cause death, mortality during follow-up, major vascular complications, major bleeding, pacemaker, or stroke rate (<30 days). Studies were excluded if they considered female gender merely in subgroup analysis.
Results We included 14 observational studies with a total of 7,973 patients (4,242 women, 3,731 men). At 30 days (12 studies, 3,044 women, 2,784 men), female sex was associated with a significantly lower mortality rate (odds ratio [95% confidence interval] 0.78 [0.64, 0.96]). Of the 14 studies included for analysis, 12 provided data on mortality during follow-up that likewise show a survival advantage for women (OR 0.70 [0.59, 0.82]). Whereas the major vascular complication rate was greater in women (11 studies, 3,731 women, 3,342 men; OR 1.72 [1.41, 2.09]), major bleeding (8 studies, 2,124 women, 2,100 men; OR 1.13 [0.95, 1.33]) was not. Pacemaker and stroke rate were not significantly different between the groups.
Conclusion In treatment with TAVI, there is evidence for a significantly greater overall survival benefit in women over men.

AB  - Abstract Introduction: Valve weight in calcific aortic stenosis (AS) is thought to be mostly secondary to calcification and female sex is associated with less calcium burden. Contemporary data describing sex-related differences in pre-operative clinical characteristics, hemodynamics, and postoperative aortic valve weight (AVW) are scarce. Hypothesis: AVW will correlate well with CT calcium score and female sex will be associated with lower AVW even after correction for anthropomorphic and clinical factors. Methods: Postoperative AVW was measured in 1090 consecutive patients (692 male, 398 female) with AS. Results: Women were slightly older (74±11 vs 73±10 years, p=0.04), had more hypertension (79% vs 73%, p=0.04), slightly higher NYHA functional class (2.64±0.71 vs 2.51±0.72, p=0.004), and less coronary artery disease (39% vs 54%, p<0.0001). Women had higher ejection fraction (63±10 vs 59±12, p<0.0001) and smaller aortic valve area (0.80±0.19 vs 0.91±0.18 cm2, p<0.0001), but had a similar indexed valve area (0.44±0.09 vs 0.44±0.10 cm2/m2, p=0.49) and mean gradient (51±15 vs 49±14 mm Hg, p=0.10). In 142 patients, CT aortic valve calcium score correlated well with AVW (r=0.80, p<0.0001) and was lower in women compared to men (2400±1170 AU vs 3557±1616, p<0.0001). Univariate and multivariate discriminators of AVW can be found in table 1. Conclusions: CT coronary calcium scoring correlates well with AVW and the major correlates of increased AVW are male sex, bicuspid valve, and increased left ventricular outflow tract size. Despite a similar severity of AS, women had less aortic valve calcium and lower AVW compared to men even after correction for other confounding variables. This may be related to a greater degree of aortic valve fibrosis than calcification in women and/or varying adaptability to AS in men versus women. Examination of potential sex-related differences in the pathophysiology of AS may be helpful in elucidating potential non-surgical targets to treat AS.

AB  - Background: Current data suggest that women experience different outcomes to men following transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). We reviewed the Mount Sinai valve database to compare men and women undergoing TAVR according to procedural characteristics and outcomes. Methods: 124 patients underwent TAVR at Mount Sinai from May 2012-2014. All patients received Edwards Sapien valves. Follow-up was conducted at 30-days. Results: Women accounted for 61% (n=76) of the TAVR cohort. The mean age of women was 80.7, and 82.2 for men (p=0.30). Men were more likely to have undergone previous cardiac bypass surgery and were more likely to be on dialysis and have a pacemaker or intra-cardiac defibrillator in-situ (27.1% vs. 7.9%, p=0.004). Women had lower baseline hemoglobin. These disparities did not translate to differences in STS Risk Score or EuroScore. In women, the aortic annulus (21.2mm vs. 23.4mm, plt;0.0001), left atrial (24.6mm vs. 27.2mm, p = 0.02) and left ventricular (3.09mm vs. 4.11mm, plt;0.001) areas were smaller, as was the ilio-femoral artery diameter (7.4mm vs. 8.03mm, p=0.02). In contrast, men had a lower left ventricular ejection fraction (49.9% vs. 57.6%, p=0.004) and mean aortic valve gradient (43.5mmHg vs. 48.8mmHg, p=0.004). Procedural length did not differ between genders, nor did the method of approach. Women were less likely to experience conduction complications requiring pacemaker insertion both intra-procedurally (2.6% vs. 12.5%, p=0.03) and 30-days post-discharge (2.7% vs. 13.2%, p = 0.03). Women were more likely to receive in-hospital transfusion (51.3% vs. 18.8%, p=0.0003), but mortality rates did not differ between genders (7.0% vs. 6.7%, p=0.5). Conclusion: Despite discrepancies in some important pre-procedural parameters, as well as rates of post-procedural conduction abnormalities and in-hospital transfusion, these did not translate into differences in mortality rates between genders in patients undergoing TAVR.

AB  - Purpose: Hypertrophic response to pressure overload is gender-specific. Our aim was to evaluate gender differences in left ventricular (LV) remodeling, myocardial fibrosis and biomarkers of extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling in isolated severe aortic stenosis (AS). Methods: We analyzed clinical and echocardiographic parameters, at baseline and 6 months after valve replacement (AVR), in a prospective cohort of 132 severe AS patients, 77 females (58.3%). A subgroup analysis of myocardial fibrosis and baseline ECM biomarkers procollagen type I carboxy-terminal peptide (PIP), metalloproteinase (MMP) 1 and 9, and tissue inhibitor of MMP (TIMP) 1 and 2 was performed. Results: Women had smaller LV diameters, volumes and LV mass (LVM), but these differences disappeared after indexation. When comparing the %observed LVM/predicted LVM, women had more inappropriate LVM increase than men (160.93±53,37% vs 140.25±37,35%, p=0.031). Six months after AVR, LVM regression was similar between genders but women had more residual hypertrophy (68.8% vs 39.6%, p=0.002). Baseline %observed LVM/predicted LVM inversely correlated with 6 months LVM regression (r=-0.330, p=0.001), and a cutoff of >142% had a 72.5% sensibility and 68.6% specificity for predicting residual LVH at 6 months (AUC 0.732, p>0.001). Baseline PIP levels tended to be higher in women (775.7±250.2 vs 649.1±94.1 ng/ml, p=0.067) and TIMP1/MMP1 levels positively correlated with baseline LVM index (r=0.681, p=0.003) only in women. Moreover, women had significantly more fibrosis than men (median of 15.39% (P25-75:7.95-29.09) vs 10.04% (P25-75:6.00-14.96)). In women higher TIMP2 and TIMP1/MMP1 levels correlated with lesser 6 month LVM regression (TIMP2:r=-0.650, p=0.022; TIMP1/MMP1:r=-0.748, p=0.005). Conclusions: In AS women develop more inappropriate LVM than men and have more residual hypertrophy after surgery. A gender-specific ECM remodeling, with more interstitial fibrosis in women, could explain these differences.

AB  - Background: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) appears to be an effective alternative to conventional aortic valve replacement (AVR) for the treatment of aortic stenosis in surgical high-risk patients. However, gender differences in patients treated with TAVI or conventional aortic valve replacement (AVR) have been poorly investigated. Methods: From 2011 to 2012, 30,292 consecutive patients undergoing repair for aortic valve disease were prospectively enrolled into German Aortic Valve Registry (GARY). For the present analysis patients were divided into four categories: females treated with TAVI or AVR and males treated with TAVI or AVR. Results: Female patients had a comparable general health status, but were older and more likely to be treated with TAVI than male patients (table). Among those with AVR, concomitant coronary bypass surgery was more often performed in male patients (38.8 versus 28.2%). In the TAVI group the transfemoral access route was more frequently used among females (72.2 versus 63.3%). The rate of TIA/stroke was similar in all groups, but significant aortic regurgitation (≥ II°) and vascular complications were more often observed in the TAVI cohort. The incidence of in-hospital death was lowest in male patients with AVR, followed by female patients with AVR and both TAVI groups. Conclusions: Female patients undergoing repair for aortic valve disease were older and more likely to be treated with TAVI in comparison to their male counterparts. In-hospital mortality was higher in female patients treated with AVR, whereas mortality rates were similar in both groups treated with TAVI. (Table Presented).

Methods: PUBMED, MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were screened. Inclusion criteria were: AS treated with all forms of TAVI; studies targeting specifically on sex/gender differences; and at least two of the following outcome data: 30-day all-cause mortality, all-cause mortality during follow-up (>3 months), major vascular complications, and major bleeding. Exclusion criteria were studies in which gender was merely considered in subgroup analysis. Results: 11 observational studies with a total of 5867 patients (3087 women, 2780 men) were included. At 30 days (10 studies, 2716 women, 2438 men), female sex was associated with a significant, 25% lower mortality rate [odds ratio (95% confidence interval) = 0.75 (0.60-0.94)]. Nine studies with 4985 patients (2578 women, 2407 men) providing data on mortality during follow-up reported a significant survival advantage for women [0.67 (0.53-0.83)]. Whereas major vascular complication rate was greater in women (9 studies, 2757 women, 2536 men) [1.72 (1.39 to 2.14)], major bleedings (7 studies, 1977 women, 1899 men) were not significantly different between genders [1.12 (0.91, 1.37)]. Conclusions: There is evidence for a significant overall survival benefit in women over men treated with TAVI.

AB  - Background The impact of female sex on mortality after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is controversial. Post-procedural aortic regurgitation (AR)≥2 has been associated with poor outcomes. Whether sex differences in post-procedural AR≥2 could contribute to a mortality difference between women and men is not known. Methods Six hundred fifty-six patients, women (53.1%), men (46.9%), with aortic stenosis underwent TAVI with the CoreValve system (92.8%) or the Edwards SAPIEN valve system (7.2%). AR was graded semiquantitatively as 0=none, 1=trivial, 2=mild, 3=moderate, and 4=severe. The incidence of post-procedural AR≥2 was reported. Results Procedural success was similar in women as compared to men (97.9 vs 96.7%, P=0.32). Post-procedural AR≥2 occurred less frequently in women than in men (20.9 vs 29.6%, P=0.01). After a median follow-up of 434 days, all-cause mortality tended to be lower in women than in men (20.7 vs 26.6%, logrank P=0.10), and was significantly higher in patients with AR≥2 than in those without (34.8 vs 19.7%, logrank P<0.001). AR≥2 [hazard ratio (HR) 1.73, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.22-2.43, P=0.002], but not female sex (P=0.17) was an independent predictor of all-cause death at multivariable Cox regression. The predictive value of AR≥2 was restricted to men (HR 2.96, P<0.001 among men; HR 0.86, P=0.60 among women; P for interaction=0.002). Conclusions Women, as compared to men, present a trend toward lower mortality. A significant lower incidence of post-procedural AR≥2 among women contributes to this finding. Female sex, however, was not a significant independent predictor of death. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Objective: Knowledge of gender differences, including outcomes and resource allocation, among bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) patients undergoing aortic valve replacement (AVR) is sparse. Methods: We analyzed 418 consecutive BAV patients (317 men and 101 women) that underwent AVR from 04/2004 to 04/2011 and had assessment of aortic diameter (AD). To reduce gender bias, we used propensity score (PS) matching to adjust for 22 factors, including age, comorbidities, other concomitant surgical procedures and maximal AD. Results: Women were significantly older than men (61.9±13.6 vs. 56.9±12.8 years, p < 0.001), had smaller AD (AD <45 mm: 70% vs. 55%, p = 0.022) and similar follow-up (4±2.2 vs. 4±2.0 years). For the total group, women had longer cross-clamp and bypass times (p < 0.001), received smaller valve implants (p < 0.001), had longer intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay (LOS) (p = 0.016), had more prolonged hospital LOS (third quartile (Q3) 7 vs. 6 days, p = 0.012), underwent more reoperations for non-cardiac reasons (7% vs. 2%, p = 0.022) and required more postoperative blood products (55% vs. 37%, p < 0.001). Operative, discharge and 30-day mortality (1% men vs. 2% women, p = 0.41) and overall survival (90.6% men vs. 89.6% women at 5 years, p = 0.73) were similar. Figure 1 histograms indicate excellent PS-matching in the resulting 94 pairs. Women had longer ICU LOS (median 32.3 vs. 25.6 hours, p = 0.005), more prolonged hospital LOS (Q3 7 vs. 6 days, p = 0.021), more reoperations for non-cardiac reasons (6% vs. 0%, p = 0.013), more postoperative blood products (56% vs. 36%, p = 0.005). Women underwent atrial fibrillation surgical ablation less frequently (3% vs. 12%, p = 0.026). Operative, discharge and 30-day mortality (1% men vs. 2% women, p = 0.56) and overall survival (91.3% men vs. 91.5% women at 5 years, p = 0.57) were similar. There were no aortic valve reinterventions during follow-up. Conclusions: Women had significantly longer ICU LOS, more prolonged hospital LOS, more reops for non-cardiac reasons and postoperative blood transfusions. Given these substantial differences, future resource-allocation and cost-effectiveness strategies require enhanced focus on gender differences. (Figure Presented).

AB  - Objective: To compare women with men with respect to baseline characteristics and short-term outcome in a contemporary nationwide cohort of patients that underwent isolated AV surgery. Methods: All patients (N = 8717; 56% males (N = 4888)) that underwent isolated AV surgery (replacement: N = 8612, 98.8%; reconstruction: N = 105, 1.2%) in the Netherlands between January 2007 and December 2011 were included in this study. Differences in patient and procedural characteristics, and in-hospital outcome were compared between male en female patients. Results: Female patients were generally older (mean age, 71 vs. 66 years, p < 0.001) and had higher logistic EuroSCORE (median score, 6.6 vs. 4.3, p < 0.001). Male patients presented more often with extracardiac arteriopathy (9.7% versus 6.7%; p < 0.001), prior cardiac surgery (12.3% versus 6.9%; p < 0.001), renal disease (2.3% versus 1.0%; p < 0.001), active endocarditis (5.9% versus 1.7%; p < 0.001), critical preoperative state (2.5% versus 1.5%; p = 0.002), moderate (15.5% versus 10.4%; p < 0.001) or poor (4.2% versus 1.6%; p < 0.001) left ventricular function and underwent more often emergent surgery (3.2% versus 1.5%; p < 0.001). Female patients underwent more often AV replacement (99.3% versus 98.4%; p < 0.001) and received more often stented (68.7% versus 58.4%; p < 0.001) and stentless (6.1% versus 3.4%; p < 0.001) bioprostheses. Male patients, on the other hand, received more often a mechanical prosthesis (36.5% versus 24.4%; p < 0.001). Female patients had comparable in-hospital mortality with male patients (OR 1.20, 95% CI 0.90-1.61; p = 0.220). In males, the AUC for the logistic Euroa SCORE was 0.82 (95% CI 0.78-0.86) versus 0.75 (95% CI 0.69- 0.80) in females. The calibration of the logistic EuroSCORE model resulted in p-values of p = 0.002 and p = 0.0033 for males and females, respectively. Conclusions: Compared to males, female patients undergoing isolated aortic valve surgery are older, but have less EuroSCORE risk factors. The suboptimal performance of EuroSCORE in female patients warrants further exploration of gender- specific determinants of early mortality after isolated aortic valve surgery and calls for the development of gender specific risk stratification models for this group of patients.

AB  - Objective: Although gender-related differences in patient presentation, morbidity and mortality are well described for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), there is uncertainty about whether this also applies to patients undergoing concomitant aortic valve (AV) and CABG surgery. The aim of this study was to evaluate gender- related differences in patients undergoing concomitant AV and CABG surgery. Methods: All patients (N = 5,867, 67% males (N = 3,937)) that underwent AV surgery (replacement: N = 5,817, 99.1%; reconstruction: N = 50, 0.9%) with concomitant CABG in the Netherlands between January 2007 and December 2011 were included in this study. Differences in patient and procedural characteristics, and in-hospital outcome were compared between male en female patients. Results: Female patients were older (mean age, 75 vs. 72 years, p < 0.001) and had higher logistic EuroSCORE (median score, 8.1 vs. 5.5, p < 0.001). Male patients presented more often with chronic lung disease (16.8% vs. 12.1%; p < 0.001), extracardiac arteriopathy (18.9% vs. 12.9%; p < 0.001), neurological dysfunction (3.5% vs. 2.3%; p < 0.001), prior cardiac surgery (4.7% vs. 3.3%; p < 0.001), renal disease (2.7% vs. 1.4%; p < 0.001), active endocarditis (1.0% vs. 0.4%; p < 0.001), moderate (21.2% vs. 15.3%; p < 0.001) and poor (5.7% vs. 2.5%; p < 0.001) left ventricular function. Female patients received more often stented (81.3% vs. 73.6%; p < 0.001) and stentless (5.2% vs. 4.0%; p < 0.001) bioprostheses. Male patients, on the other hand, received more often a mechanical prosthesis (21.7% vs. 12.3%; p < 0.001). Female patients underwent more often total venous grafting (30.0% vs. 26.3%; p = 0.003). In-hospital mortality was 4.1% (n = 239) and higher in female compared to male patients (OR 2.00, 95% CI 1.44-2.79; p < 0.001). In males, the AUC for the logistic EuroSCORE was 0.78 (95% CI 0.73-0.82) versus 0.69 (95% CI 0.63-0.74) in females. The calibration of the logistic EuroSCORE model resulted in p-values of p < 0.001 and p = 0.09 for males and females, respectively. Conclusions: There are considerable gender differences in patient presentation, operative characteristics, and inhospital mortality in contemporary concomitant AV and CABG surgery. The predictive value of logistic EuroSCORE is substantially better in men. This calls for the development of gender specific risk stratification models for combined AV and CABG surgery.

AB  - Background: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has been rapidly adopted into clinical practice. However, gender differences in patients treated with TAVI or conventional aortic valve replacement (AVR) have been poorly investigated. The German Aortic Valve Registry (GARY) recruited for the first time patients undergoing TAVI or AVR and therefore offers the opportunity to evaluate the impact of gender. Methods: From 2011 to 2012, 30,292 consecutive patients undergoing repair for aortic valve disease were prospectively enrolled into GARY. For the present analysis patients were divided into four categories: females treated with TAVI or AVR and males treated with TAVI or AVR. Results: Female patients were more likely to be treated with TAVI (n=5,118 versus 4,153), whereas the majority of male patients underwent AVR (n=13,626 versus 7,395). On average, female patients were older than male patients (AVR: 71.9 versus 68.4 years; TAVI: 82.0 versus 79.7 years). Among those with AVR, concomitant coronary bypass surgery was more often performed in male patients (38.8 versus 28.2%). In the TAVI group the transfemoral access route was more often used among females (72.2 versus 63.3%). The rate of relevant aortic regurgitation (≥ II°) was very low in the AVR group (0.4%). In the TAVI cohort significant aortic regurgitation was more often observed, but this was less frequent among female patients versus males (5.0 versus 7.2%). The procedural complication rate during TAVI procedures was higher in women, with at least twofold higher rates of coronary occlusions, pericardial tamponades, annular ruptures, and vascular complications. In contrary, male patients more often experienced residual aortic regurgitation ≥2+. The incidence of in-hospital death was lowest in male patients with AVR (2.6%), followed by female patients with AVR (3.8%) and both TAVI groups (5.3% each). Conclusions: Female patients undergoing repair for aortic valve disease were older and more likely to be treated with TAVI in comparison to their male counterparts. In-hospital mortality was higher in female patients treated with AVR, whereas mortality rates were similar in both groups treated with TAVI.

AB  - Purpose: Improvement in health status is considered to be one of the principal objectives of heart valve surgery. This study aimed to investigate differences in physical selfreported health status between men and women up to 12 years after aortic valve replacement (AVR). Methods: The study had a retrospective design. A postal questionnaire was sent to 708 patients that had undergone isolated AVR from Jan. 2000 to Dec. 2011 that were still alive without known cognitive impairment by April 2013. Self-reported health status was assessed by the Short Form (SF) 12 and New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification. Multiple linear regression was used to analyze health status with respect to potential explanatory variables. Results: The response rate was 77% (542/708). 60% were men. 58% were ≥ 70 years (mean 70, range 20-94 years) and 336 (64%) had a biological valve implant. The prevalence of the most frequently self-reported comorbidities were: previous acute myocardial infarction (AMI) 66 (12%), previous stroke 73 (13%), intermittent atrial fibrillation (AF) 150 (25%), insomnia 164 (31%), depression 86 (16%) and anxiety 83 (16%). Women were older than men (p< 0.001), and more women than men were living alone (p< 0.001). Most of the participants (85%) were in NYHAclass I- II. Women reported significant higher NYHA-class than men, mean 2.08 and 1.67, respectively (p<0.001). Men had higher SF-12 Physical sum score (PCS) than women (p< 0.001). The SF-12 Mental dimension did not show gender differences (p=0.188). In the linear regression analysis gender, age, previous AMI, stroke, COPD, anxiety and insomnia were significant predictors for PCS and explained 33% of the variation, while valve type, PM, AF, kidney disease, cancer or depression were not significant predictors. Patients with previous AMI scored on average (SE) 4.6 (1.7) lower than those without AMI (p=0.007). Patients with previous stroke scored 3.6 (1.6) lower than those without stroke (p=0.026). Patients with COPD scored 5.1 (2.3) lower than those without COPD (p=0.029) and patients with insomnia scored 2.9 (2.2) lower than those without insomnia (p=0.022). Patient with self-reported anxiety scored on average 7.2 (2.3) lower than those without such problems (p=0.002). Conclusions: Men reported better long-term physical functional level as well as better health status on physical dimension than women after AVR. No gender differences were found on the mental health dimension. Higher age, female gender, previous AMI, stroke, COPD, self-reported anxiety and insomnia were predictors for worse physical health status in patients with isolated AVR.

AB  - Purpose: Quality of life has been shown to be influenced by aortic valve replacement. However, to our knowledge, no previous studies have investigated depression in patients after heart valve surgery. Therefore this study aimed to investigate depression in patients with AVR (group A) and concomitant AVR and CABG (group B). Methods: The study had a retrospective design. A postal questionnaire was sent to 1191 patients still alive in April 2013 that had undergone AVR with or without concomitant CABG from January 2000 to December 2011. Selfreported depression was assessed by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). The 14 items on depression HADS-D was used in this study. Response options on all items are from 0 (no symptoms) to 3 (maximum symptoms). The scores on each subscale range from 0 to 21. The HADS has optimal cut-off score of at least 8 on both subscales for identifying possible cases of depressive disorder. Results: In all, 912 (77%) patients responded ; 542/708 in group A and 370/483 in group B. Sixty percent in group A were men and 68% in group B (p=0.021). Mean age was 70 (13) years (range 20-94 years) and 77 (9) years (range 25-95 years) in group A and B respectively (p<0.001). Fifty-eight percent were ≥70 years in group A and 79% in group B (p<0.001). Participants in group B were more often living alone (p=0.007), had lower educational level (p=0.042) and were less employed (p<0.001). Most of the participants were in NYHA-class I or II, 85% in group A and 83% in group B, with no differences between the groups (p=0.190), but within both groups men reported significant lower NYHA-class than women (p<0.001), women were older than men (p<0.001) and more women than men were living alone (p<0.001). HADS-D ≥ 8 was found in 12% of those <70 years of age and 19% of those ≥ 70 years of age (p=0.007 and 14% in group A and 20% in group B (p=0.040). No gender differences were found (p=1.000). Conclusions: The results indicate that patients with AVR and concomitant CABG are more often depressed than patients with isolated AVR. Patient ≥70 years of age are more depressed than younger patients, but there was no difference on depression level according to gender. Further research will be needed to elucidate factors associated with the observed differences.

AB  - Gender differences exist in outcomes after percutaneous coronary intervention and coronary artery bypass graft surgery but have yet to be fully explored after transcatheter aortic valve implantation. We aimed to investigate gender differences after transcatheter aortic valve implantation in the UK National Institute for Cardiovascular Outcomes Research registry. A retrospective analysis was performed of Medtronic CoreValve and Edwards SAPIEN implantation in 1,627 patients (756 women) from January 2007 to December 2010. Men had more risk factors: poor left ventricular systolic function (11.9% vs 5.5%, p <0.001), 3-vessel disease (19.4% vs 9.2%, p <0.001), previous myocardial infarction (29.5% vs 13.0%, p <0.001), peripheral vascular disease (32.4% vs 23.3%, p <0.001), and higher logistic EuroSCORE (21.8 ± 14.2% vs 21.0 ± 13.4%, p = 0.046). Thirty-day mortality was 6.3% (confidence interval 4.3% to 7.9%) in women and 7.4% (5.6% to 9.2%) in men and at 1 year, 21.9% (18.7% to 25.1%) and 22.4% (19.4% to 25.4%), respectively. There was no mortality difference: p = 0.331 by log-rank test; hazard ratio for women 0.91 (0.75 to 1.10). Procedural success (96.6% in women vs 96.4% in men, p = 0.889) and 30-day cerebrovascular event rates (3.8% vs 3.7%, p = 0.962) did not differ. Women had more major vascular complications (7.5% vs 4.2%, p = 0.004) and less moderate or severe postprocedural aortic regurgitation (7.5% vs 12.5%, p = 0.001). In conclusion, despite a higher risk profile in men, there was no gender-related mortality difference; however, women had more major vascular complications and less postprocedural moderate or severe aortic regurgitation. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Background: Balloon aortic valvuloplasty (BAV) is being used more and more as a bridging procedure to more definitive surgery or TAVR. The present study aims at evaluating the gender differences in clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients undergoing BAV in TAVR era. Methods: From April 2009 to August 2012, the data from 331 BAV procedures done on patients with severe symptomatic AS were prospectively entered into a dedicated database. Clinical, hemodynamic, procedure and outcome data were collected. All events were defined according to Valve Academic Research Consortium [VARC] criteria. Results: The study cohort included 331 patients with mean age 82.5 ± 10.2 years and mean aortic valve area 0.61 ± 0.20. Men constitute 46% of the study population. Prior history of coronary artery disease (CAD), prior CABG, and lower EF [25-40%] were higher in men compared to women at presentation. On the other hand women had higher Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) score (p = 0.006). There were no significant differences in the procedural characteristics except for significantly smaller balloon size (p < 0.001) in women compared to men. Procedure complications similar both groups (overall 7%). All cause mortality 30 day and 1 year [28.5% vs. 34.2%, p = 0.3] similar in both groups. Conclusion: Women have higher STS score and men have higher CAD burden at presentation though the procedure outcomes, in hospital complications and one year all cause mortality after BAV have been similar (Table Presented).

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Aortic geometry changes throughout life are not well defined. This investigation delineates aortic geometry across the adult age spectrum and determines the gender-related influence of aging on aortic morphometry. METHODS: Contrast-enhanced computed tomography scans of all aortic segments in 195 subjects (94 women, 101 men, average age 57 ± 20 years) free of vascular disease were analysed. Lengths and diameters of each aortic segment as well as width, height and tortuosity of the thoracic aorta were compared between both genders. RESULTS: Aortic diameters and lengths were larger in men than women (P < 0.001); however, after adjustment for body surface area (BSA), the ascending aorta and aortic arch revealed greater diameters in women than in men (P = 0.001 and P = 0.011, respectively). All aortic segment dimensions increased in a similar pattern with age for both genders, except the ascending aorta diameter, which increased +3.4% (P < 0.001) per decade in women and +2.6% (P < 0.001) per decade in men. Owing to more dynamic ascending aortic growth in women, absolute diameters were similar in both genders at an older age (>70 years old: 3.4 ± 0.3 vs 3.5 ± 0.3 cm, P = 0.241). CONCLUSIONS: Female gender is associated with smaller aortic dimensions, but only at a young age. The dynamics of aortic growth throughout life are greater in women than in men. Gender-related changes in aortic geometry provide a hypothesis for the predominance of aortic dissection in young male patients, which normalizes between genders with increasing age. © The Author 2014.

AB  - Sex medicine can be applied to define the effect of male or female sex-associated differences on the prevalence of congenital heart defects (CHDs), on clinical manifestation of the latter, on means of dealing with the defects and facing consequent surgical treatment, as well as on the success of surgery. The widespread use of modern databases has undoubtedly enhanced the possibility of these observations compared to the past, when findings were limited to case series from single cardiology or paediatric heart surgery units. The aim of the present review is to assess all publications present in the literature on sex differences and CHD, placing particular emphasis on both contradictory aspects and less acknowledged issues. Furthermore, a section of the review is devoted to the effect of sex differences on cardiac arrhythmias, particularly the largely genetically predetermined electrophysiological differences observed between men and women.

AB  - Objectives: The aim of this analysis is to examine the influence of gender differences on the outcome after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) from a multicenter real-world registry in Germany (TAVI registry). Background: The impact of gender differences on the clinical outcome after TAVI was examined in small studies with conflicting results. Methods: Consecutive patients (n = 1,432) undergoing TAVI in the period between January 2009 and June 2010 in Germany were evaluated. Differences in all-cause mortality were examined with Kaplan-Meier estimates and proportional hazards models. Results: Women comprised 57.8 % of the cohort. The Edwards Sapien valve (18.5 %) and CoreValve (81.5 %) were used through the transfemoral (87.7 %), subclavian (3.0 %), transapical (8.6 %), or transaortic approach (0.7 %). At baseline, women had higher aortic gradients and were older. Men had more comorbidities: prior myocardial infarction, prior revascularization, prior coronary artery bypass surgery, peripheral arterial vascular disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Women had more periprocedural vascular complications in comparison to men (25.2 vs. 17.2 %, p < 0.001). There was no significant difference in mortality at 30-day follow-up (7.6 % for women vs. 8.6 % for men, p = 0.55). The adjusted HR for 1-year all-cause mortality favored women, HR 0.75 (95 % CI 0.57-0.98, p = 0.0346) with a mortality rate of 17.3 vs. 23.6 % for men. Conclusions: Female gender is associated with better 1-year survival after TAVI. These results suggest that TAVI could be the best treatment modality for elderly women with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis. © 2014 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Objectives The purpose of this study was to test whether adaptive or maladaptive remodeling is associated with survival in women and men after aortic valve replacement (AVR). Background Women with isolated aortic valve stenosis (AS) develop more concentric left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) than men in similar disease states. We recently reported less up-regulation of profibrotic genes at AVR and faster LVH regression post-operatively in women than in men, suggesting that there are sex differences in the adaptation to pressure overload and its regression. Methods The study cohort included 128 patients (age 70.0 ± 9.6 years, 49%women) undergoing AVR for AS. Echocardiography was obtained before and 4.0 ± 1.6 years after surgery. Factor analysis was used to classify LVH as adaptive (combiningsmaller left ventricular [LV]mass/diameters andgreater relativewall thicknesses) ormaladaptive.Myocardial tissue samples from the LV septum were obtained during AVR to analyze cardiac fibrosis and associated key molecular regulators. Results Before AVR, LVH was classified as adaptive in 62% of women and 45% of men (p < 0.050). Four years after AVR, adaptive LVH was observed in 75% of women and 49% of men (p < 0.031). At surgery, more cardiac fibrosis was present in men compared with women (p < 0.05). Higher levels of transforming growth factor beta 1 (p < 0.01), SMAD2 phosphorylation (p < 0.001), and periostin expression (p < 0.05) were found in men than in women. Women with maladaptive LVH had worse survival than women with adaptive LVH (p < 0.050), whereas the pattern of LVH did not affect survival in men (p < 0.307). Conclusions Women more frequently exhibit adaptive LV remodeling with less fibrosis than men. Maladaptive LVH is associated with worse survival in women. Thus, sex should be considered as a strong modulating factor when management of patients with AS is discussed. (J Am Coll Cardiol Img 2014;7:1073-80)

AB  - Aims Women with aortic stenosis develop a more concentric form of LV hypertrophy than men. However, the molecular factors underlying sex differences in LV remodelling are incompletely understood. We took an unbiased approach to identify sex-specific patterns in gene expression and pathway regulation, and confirmed the most prominent findings in human hearts.
Methods and results Echocardiography was performed in 104 patients (53.8% women) with aortic stenosis before aortic valve replacement. LV mass, LV end-diastolic diameter, and relative wall thickness were included in a factor analysis to generate an index classifying LV remodelling as adaptive or maladaptive. Maladaptive remodelling was present in 64.6% of male and in 32.7% of female patients (P < 0.01). Genome-wide expression profiling of LV samples was performed in a representative subgroup of 19 patients (52.6% women) compared with samples from healthy controls (n = 18). Transcriptome characterization revealed that fibrosis-related genes/pathways were induced in male overloaded ventricles, while extracellular matrix-related and inflammatory genes/pathways were repressed in female overloaded ventricles (adjusted P < 0.05). We confirmed gene regulation by quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and immunoblotting analysis, and we further demonstrate the relevance of our findings by histological documentation of higher fibrosis in men than in women.
Conclusion We conclude that in pressure overload distinct molecular processes are regulated between men and women. Maladaptive LV remodelling occurs more frequently in men and is associated with greater activation of profibrotic and inflammatory markers. Collectively, sex-specific regulation of these processes may contribute to sex differences in the progression to heart failure.

AB  - Objectives The aim of this study is to evaluate gender-related differences in clinical presentation and mortality in patients undergoing isolated surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR). Methods We performed a retrospective analysis of all patients undergoing isolated SAVR from 2000 to 2011 in our center. Patient data were compared with regard to gender including baseline characteristics, 30-day, and late mortality. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were used to analyze long-term survival up to 10 years follow-up. Independent risk factors for 30-day and late mortality were identified using a Cox regression model. Results Two thousand one hundred ninety-seven patients were included, 1290 (58.7%) male patients and 907 (41.3%) female patients. Female patients were older (70±11 vs. 64±13 years, p<0.001), presented with higher logistic EuroSCORE (7.5±5.8 vs. 5.6±6%, p=0.006), and more common NYHA class III or IV (71 vs. 65%, p=0.05). Male patients presented more often with LV dysfunction (7.5 vs. 2.8%, p<0.001) and endocarditis (4.1 vs. 1.7%, p<0.001) than female patients. Intraoperatively, female patients were more likely to have had a complete sternotomy (65 vs. 52%, p<0.001) and SAVR with a bioprosthesis (87 vs. 78%, p<0.001). Female patients exhibited a higher 30-day mortality (4.4 vs. 1.6%, p<0.001) and late mortality (13 vs. 9.6%, p=0.04) than male patients. After adjustment for baseline characteristics, only female gender was an independent predictor for 30-day mortality (HR 2.2, 95% CI 0.98 to 5.2, p=0.05) and age as independent predictor for late mortality (HR 1.07, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.1, p<0.001). Conclusion Female patients were older and sicker and may therefore exhibit higher 30-day and late mortality than male patients. Female gender per se was a predictor for 30-day but not for late mortality. doi: 10.1111/jocs.12442 (J Card Surg 2014;29:772-778)

AB  - Objectives: Possible risk-factors for gender-specific differences in outcome of ascending aortic aneurysm surgery with respect to aneurysm size (diameter and normalized diameter=diameter/BSA (body surface area) and extent of aortic disease were evaluated. Methods: 548 consecutive patients (male: n=390, age: 58.3±14.4 years; female: n=158, age: 65.3±12.9 years), who underwent surgery for aneurysms of the ascending aorta from 1994 to 2011 were retrospectively analysed. Results: Analysis of possible preoperative risk-factors revealed: women were significantly older (p<0.001) and presented with significantly more hypertension (p=0.04) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD, p=0.017). Men had significantly more previous cardiac operations than women (p=0.016). No gender differences were found regarding prevalence of aortic valve pathology, Marfan syndrome and NYHA status. Mean aortic diameters were 5.86±1.34 cm in men and 5.74±1.04 cm in women, whereas normalized diameters were significantly larger in women (3.10±0.6 cm vs. 2.75±0,5 cm, p≤0.001). The aortic arch was significantly more involved in aneurysm formation in women (p=0.04), whereas no gender differences were observed for other diseased parts of the aorta. Follow-up was complete for 93% and mean follow-up time was 3.9±3.9 (0-17.8) years. Overall, 30-day mortality was 4.8% (n=23): 3.5% in men (n=12) and 7.9% in women (n=11; p=0.058). Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed a significantly reduced long-term survival for women (log-rank p=0.0052). Seven preoperative variables were identified as risk factors for long-term mortality by univariate regression analysis: age (HR 1.06, p<0.001), female gender (HR 2.13, p=0.0064), creatinine (HR 1.96, p=0.0012), urea (HR 1.02, p=0.0022), NYHA status (HR 1.58, p=0.0014), COPD (HR 2.67, p=0.0036) and renal insufficiency (HR 3.61, p=<0.0001). Conclusions: Long-term survival after surgery for ascending aortic aneurysms was significantly reduced in women, whereas early mortality was not significantly different between genders. The observed significant larger normalized aortic diameters and more involvement of the arch may reflect a more progressed state of aortic disease in women. Furthermore, differences in comorbidities may contribute to the observed gender differences in outcome. However, further studies are necessary to elucidate underlying reasons.

AB  - Purpose: Few studies have been published up-to-date to identify gender differences in aortic valve stenosis (AVS), including arterial stiffness (AS), which is an important cause of higher global left ventricle (LV) afterload and increased mortality. New echocardiographic indexes have been recently proposed to estimate the global LV burden in AVS: valvular arterial impedance (Zva) and energy loss index (ELI). We aimed to identify gender differences in clinical and functional echocardiographic indexes of LV-aorta system global stiffness in patients (pts) with preserved LV ejection fraction. Methods: Clinical and transthoracic echocardiographic data in consecutive 87 pts (38 males, 49 females; mean age 73 years) with preserved global ejection fraction (mean EF 59%), undergoing elective cardiac surgery for severe calcific AVS, were analyzed. Results: No statistic difference between females and males was found in mean age (72.5±8.9 vs 72.7±8.6 yrs, p=.09) and mean EF (60.5±6.3 vs 58.9±6.0%, p=.21), while there was a trend for higher prevalence of coexisting coronary artery disease in men (26.5 vs 44.7%, p=.07). Higher LDL (116.7±31.2 vs 97.5±34,9 mg/dL,p=.008) and total (199.7±47 vs 174.8±55 mg/dL, p=.03) serum cholesterol and lower serum creatinine (0.7±0.2 vs 0.9±0,2 mg/dL, p=.002) and gamma-glutamyl transferase levels (18±10 vs 28±23 IU/l, p=.01) were characteristic for female population. No significant statistic difference was revealed for other common blood biochemical parameters. Women had a reduced effectiveorifice area of aortic valve (0.53±.19 vs 0.69±.25 cm2, p=.001), higher peakvelocity through the valve (480.4±2.2 vs 446.5±54.6 cm/sec, p=.011), higher peak (94±25 vs 81±20 mm Hg, p=.009) and mean (59±17 vs 49±13 mm Hg, p=.003) aortic gradient, smaller indexed LV end-diastolic volume (101.9±32 vs 148.7±74 ml/ m2, p=.0001) and lower indexed LV mass (59.7±45 vs 81.7±41 g/m2, p=.03), compared with male population. Finally, smaller aortic cross sectional area (8.13±2 vs 10.25±2 cm2, p=.01), higher Zva (5.9±2,2 vs 4,9±1,9 mmHg/ml/m2,p=.03) and reduced ELI (0.34±0.12 vs 0.4±0.14 cm2/m2, p=.04) were found in females. Conclusions: In women with severe AVS the LV-aorta coupling is altered by an increased system stiffness and reduced compliance. In our study these findings were confirmed not only by an increased mean pressure gradient, but also by reduced LV volume, smaller EOA and aortic cross-sectional area and increased left ventricular-aortic stiffness.

AB  - Background: The presence of an increased angle between left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) and the proximal ascending aorta is one of the risk factors for paravalvular regurgitation after transcatheter aortic valve replacement. We investigated the relationship of this aortic root angulation and age, gender and body mass index (BMI) using multi detector-row computed tomography (MDCT). Methods: Onehundred and fifteen consecutive patients (74 males, 61±16 year old) who underwent MDCT were studied. Patients with left ventricular dysfunction and structural heart disease were excluded. Using 3D quantitative software, cross-sectional images of the aortic annulus, sino-tubular junction, LVOT and proximal aortic root were extracted from the 3D dataset. The center point of the aorta in each image was automatically selected (points A, J, L and R respectively). The distance AL was set as half the length of AJ and the distance JR same as AJ. The angle between lines LA andARwere measured as the aortic root angle (ARA). Results: ARA was 16.1±6.6 degrees with range of 37.2 to 2.9. No gender differences were noted in ARA (14±5.3 vs. 16.7±7.2 degrees in females and males, P=NS). In both genders, the ARA did not correlate with either age, height or weight. However, ARA correlated moderately with BMI, but only in female subjects (figure). Conclusions: The angulation of the aortic root evaluated by MDCT varied widely. Clinical significance of the positive relationship between ARA and BMI in female subjects needs further investigation. (Figure presented).

AB  - BACKGROUND: LV hypertrophy has been linked to LV dysfunction, cardiac events and higher operative risk in patients with aortic stenosis (AS). However, little is known about the impact of the LV remodeling patterns on outcomes of AS patients. The aims of this study were to examine prognostic value of LV remodeling pattern on mortality in AS population and to assess potential interaction with gender. METHODS: 747 patients (69±14 y.o.; 57% men) with AS (52% severe) and preserved LV ejection fraction were included. According to LV mass index and relative wall thickness, patients were classified into 4 LV patterns: normal, concentric remodeling (CR), concentric hypertrophy (CH) and eccentric hypertrophy (EH). RESULTS: 128 (17%) had normal pattern, 157 (21%) had CR, 382 (51%) had CH and 80 (11%) had EH. During a mean follow-up of 5.9±3.8 yrs, 339 patients died, including 242 from CV causes. Ten-year survival rates were 38% in patients with CH compared to 49% in CR, 53% in EH, and 61% in patients with normal pattern (p<0.001). In multivariable analysis adjusted for age, gender, hypertension, CAD, diabetes, kidney failure, and AS severity, there was a trend (p=0.09) for association between CH and increased mortality. There was an interaction (p=0.08) between LV pattern and gender with respect to the impact on mortality: i.e. CH was associated with worse outcome in women (HR= 2.12; p<0.001, figure) but not in men (HR=1.20; p=0.21). After same adjustment, CH pattern (HR=1.48, p=0.04) was an independent predictor of mortality in women. Further adjustment for aortic valve replacement or analysis of cardiovascular mortality provided similar results. CONCLUSION: This study reports that LV concentric hypertrophy is associated with increased mortality in women with AS but not in men. Hence, besides the assessment of LV mass and hypertrophy, the type of LV pattern should also be taken into consideration for the risk stratification of patients with AS, and particularly of women.

AB  - Background: Women with aortic stenosis (AS) have better left ventricular (LV) systolic function than men, as well as more concentric LV geometry in advanced disease stages. Sex differences in LV adaptation and prognosis during progression of AS have been less explored. Methods: Doppler echocardiography and cardiovascular events were recorded during a median follow-up of 4.3 years in 979 men and 632 women aged 28-86 (mean 67±10) years participating in the Simvastatin Ezetimibe in Aortic Stenosis (SEAS) study. LV geometry was assessed by LV mass/height2.7 and relative wall thickness, thus categorizing patients with normal LV mass/height2.7 as having normal geometry or concentric remodeling, and patients with LV hypertrophy as having eccentric or concentric hypertrophy. Study outcomes were AS-related events and ischemic cardiovascular events, as well as total mortality. Results: Women and men had similar progression of AS (annual reduction in aortic valve area index of 0.02cm2/m2) during follow-up. Prevalence of LV hypertrophy increased comparably in women and men, remaining considerably higher in men throughout the study, while prevalence of concentric remodeling increased more in women: 11% at baseline vs. 29% at the last visit (both p <0.001). Compared to women, more men developed low LV ejection fraction (<50%) and low midwall shortening (<14.2%) during follow-up (both p <0.05). In multivariate Cox analyses, male gender predicted 46% higher risk of ischemic cardiovascular events, in particular more stroke and coronary artery bypass grafting, as well as 43% higher risk of death, independent of AS severity, low LV function and LV geometry (Table). AS-related events did not differ between genders. Conclusions: Men and women have a similar rate of AS progression. Men have higher prevalence of LV hypertrophy and systolic dysfunction at all stages of AS and experience more often ischemic cardiovascular events and death.

AB  - Background: Pre-operative annular assessment sizing has been considered a critical step for appropriate patient and valve size selection for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Accurate understanding of annular geometry can optimize the patient-valve interaction as assessed by immediate hemodynamic response, aortic regurgitation and residual gradient. Few studies have assessed the gender differences on annular dimensions and functional outcomes. Objectives: This study sought to compare the supra and infra annular anatomic parameters and the functional outcome according to gender in patients referred to TAVR. Methods: Patients planned to undergo TAVR were systematically evaluated by transtoracic echocardiogram. The annular geometry components compared included the diameter of the left ventricular outflow track (LVOT), aortic root and ascending aorta. We also compared the incidence of aortic regurgitation, residual mean gradient and the immediate capillary pressure response ([[Unable to Display Character: ]] mean change) following the procedure. Results: The study population comprised 192 women and 181 men (mean age: 84 ± 7 years) who underwent TAVR for symptomatic aortic stenosis. Women were characterized by a lower LVOT (1.9 ± 0.2 vs. 2.0 ± 0.2 cm; p <.01), aortic root (2.9 ± 0.4 vs. 3.3 ± 0.4 cm; p <.01) and ascending aorta (3.8 ± 0.1 vs. 4.6 ± 0.1 cm; p <.01) diameters and aortic valve area (0.6 ± 0.1 vs. 0.7 ± 0.1 cm2; p <.01). As a result, the 23-mm prosthesis size was used more in women than in men (88 vs. 20%; p <.01). The incidence of aortic regurgitation was significantly higher in women (13 vs. 6%; p <0.1) as was the residual mean gradient (13 ± 5 vs. 11 ± 4 mm Hg; p <.01). No immediate hemodynamic response was observed in women in the capillary wedge pressure compared with a statistically significant change in men ([[Unable to Display Character: ]] mean change: 1.0 ± 2.0 vs. -12.0 ± 1.4 mm Hg ; p <.01). Conclusions: The anatomical annular complex in patients undergoing TAVR differs significantly in women compared to men. The patient-valve interaction in women appears to be suboptimal compared to men with higher rates of aortic regurgitation, residual mean gradient and paradoxical immediate increase in the capillary wedge pressure.

AB  - Comparison of Clinical Outcomes after Trans-catheter Aortic Valve Implantation in Men and Women for Severe Aortic Stenosis Objectives: To evaluate sex related differences in clinical outcomes after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) for aortic stenosis by means of a meta-analysis. Background: Sex-related disparities in clinical outcomes after TAVI have been reported in a limited number of patients. We conducted a meta-analysis of all available literature to assess pooled outcomes in men and women after TAVI. Methods: A comprehensive literature search from 01/01/2000 till 05/21/2013 identified 7 studies comparing men and women who underwent TAVI for severe aortic stenosis. All-cause mortality was evaluated at 30-days,12 & 24 months follow-up. Odds ratio(OR) and 95% confidence interval(CI) were calculated using random effects model. Results: A total of 3555 patients[55% women] were included. Women were more likely to be older & had higher prevalence of HTN, porcelain aorta, pulmonary hypertension, CHF and NYHA class III-IV. Men had higher prevalence of prior CAD, MI, PAD and tobacco use. Echocardiographic and hemodynamic studies revealed smaller aortic valve area & aortic annulus diameter with higher peak(85.8±8.8mmHg vs. 76.4±3.2mmHg) and mean(47.6±6.0mmHg vs. 43.7±3.1mmHg) gradient across LVOT in women.At 30-day follow-up, women experienced lower all-cause mortality compared to men(4.6% vs. 8.0%;OR 0.59 95% CI 0.39-0.91). All-cause mortality remained lower in women at 12 & 24 month follow-up(Table). Women suffered from higher rates of major vascular and major bleeding complications. The two groups had comparable rates of MI, stroke & pacemaker implantation. Conclusion: In this meta-analysis of all available data comprising 3,555 patients, women exhibited lower all-cause mortality up to 24-months post-TAVI despite higher rates of major vascular and bleeding complications.

AB  - Background: Women with isolated aortic valve stenosis (AS) develop more favorable LV hypertrophy (LVH) with smaller cavity size, thicker walls and less interstitial fibrosis (IF) compared with men in similar disease states. This is an important prerequisite for faster regression in women after aortic valve replacement (AVR) (Petrov et al., Circulation 2010). However it is yet uncertain whether these sex differences affect survival after AVR. Methods: This prospective cohort study included 135 patients (mean age 70±9.6 years, 50% women) undergoing AVR for isolated AS. Echocardiography was obtained before, shortly after and 4±1.6 years after surgery. We established a longitudinal factor analytical model to study the development of LVH and its time course of regression. LV mass, LV diameters at end-diastole (LVID) and relative wall thickness (RWT) were included to generate one multidimensional factor representing the direction and the magnitude of changes in all three variables together. According to the results of the factor analysis, LVH was classified as adaptive (combining smaller LVID and LV mass and greater RWT) or maladaptive. Myocardial tissue samples from the LV septum were obtained during AVR in a subgroup of 46 patients (52% women) to analyse IF and associated key molecular regulators. Results: Before AVR 60% of women and 24% of men had adaptive LVH and maintained this pattern after surgery (p<0.007). In contrast 50% of men and 20% of women exhibited preoperatively maladaptive LVH persisting after AVR (p<0.029). Postoperative cross-over from maladaptive to adaptive LVH patterns or vice versa occurred infrequently in both genders. In addition more IF was present in men compared to women (p<0.04). Higher TGF-β1 (p<0.01), Smad 2 phosphorylation (p<0.001) and periostin (p<0.05) levels were found in men than in women. Regarding gender and LVH pattern the post-AVR survival was significantly better in women with adaptive LVH in comparison with women with maladaptive LVH or men (p<0.01). Conclusion: In women with AS an adaptive pattern of LVH with less myocardial fibrosis contributes to better hypertrophy reversibility and subsequent survival benefit after AVR.

AB  - Female gender has recently been suggested to predict a beneficial outcome and lower mortality following transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). The study aim was to address gender differences in outcome following TAVI and potentially to replicate these findings. The present single-center prospective registry of 326 patients with severe aortic stenosis treated by TAVI between 2008 and 2011 consisted of 181 women and 145 men. The procedural risk was not significantly different between men and women at baseline. For all-cause mortality no difference was observed at 30 days and at 12 months after TAVI. While several baseline characteristics between men and women treated by TAVI were shown to be different among the study population, no difference was observed in survival between both genders.

AB  - Background: It is controversial whether female sex affects mortality after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). Post-procedural AR ≥ 2 is a predictor of mortality after (TAVI). Sex-differences in aortic and anatomic factors may affect postprocedural AR. The aim of this study was a) to assess sex-differences in mortality after TAVI, b) to investigate sex-differences in post-procedural AR and the interaction between female sex and AR on mortality after TAVI. Methods: This is a multicenter registry enrolling consecutive patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis undergoing TAVI with the CoreValve system (92.8%) or the Edwards SAPIEN valve system (7.2%). Multivariable Cox regression was performed to compute hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Results: A total of 656 patients, median age 83 yrs, (25th-75th percentile 79-86 yrs), women (53.1%), men (46.9%) were enrolled. Body surface area (1.71 vs 1.81 p<0.001) and annulus diameter (21.5 mm vs 23 mm, p<0.001) were significantly smaller in women than in men. Procedural success was similar in women as compared to men (97.9% vs 96.7% in men, p=0.32). Post-procedural AR ≥ 2 was significantly less frequent in women than in men (20.9% vs 29.6%, p=0.01). After a median follow-up of 372 days, all-cause mortality tended to be lower in women than in men (20.7% vs 26.6%, logrank p=0.10), while it was significantly higher in patients with AR ≥ 2 than in those without (34.8% vs 19.7%, logrank P<0.001). At multivariable Cox regression post-procedural AR ≥ 2 (HR1.73, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.22-2.43 p=0.002), but not female sex (p=0.17) was an independent predictor of allcause death. AR ≥ 2 was a significant predictor of all-cause death among men (HR 2.96 p<0.001), but not among women (HR 0.86 p=0.60; p for interaction 0.002). Conclusions: Postprocedural AR ≥ 2 but not female sex, is an independent predictor of all-cause mortality at mid-term follow-up. AR ≥ 2 occurs less frequently among women, and its prognostic impact is restricted to men.

AB  - Background-There were considerable discrepancies with regard to sex-related differences in complications and prognosis after transcatheter aortic valve implantation. Methods and Results-The Cochrane library and PubMed online databases were searched. Articles reporting sex-specific post-transcatheter aortic valve implantation complications and mortality were identified. Two authors selected studies and extracted data independently. Random- and fixed-effects models were used depending on between-study heterogeneity. There were 27 articles, a total of 9118 patients, enrolled in our systematic review and meta-analysis, including 4176 men and 4942 women. Pooled analyses suggested considerable sex-related differences in complications and early as well as midterm outcomes after transcatheter aortic valve implantation. The difference in the risk for heart block requiring permanent pacemaker implantation was noted to be significant only in the subgroup of the CoreValve-dominating studies (pooled risk ratio [RR, men versus women], 1.29; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.13-1.47). Although men had significantly lower risks for major/life- threatening bleeding (pooled RR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.68-0.96) and major vascular complications (pooled RR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.37-0.66), they had poorer prognosis. In fact, male sex was associated with significantly higher risks for deaths at both 30 days (RR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.07-1.76) and 1 year (RR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.14-1.49). Conclusions-Although men had lower risks for major/life-threatening bleeding and major vascular complications after transcatheter aortic valve implantation, they had less favorable short-term and midterm survival.

AB  - Objectives: The aim of this analysis is to examine the influence of sex differences on the outcome after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) from a multi-centre real-world registry in Germany (TAVI-Registry). Background: The impact of sex differences on the clinical outcome after TAVI was examined in small studies with conflicting rersults. Methods: Consecutive patients (n=1432) undergoing TAVI in the period between January 2009 and June 2010 in Germany, were evaluated. Differences in all-cause mortality were examined with Kaplan-Meier estimates and proportional hazards models. Results: Women comprised 57.8% of the cohort. The Edwards-Sapien valve (18.5%) and CoreValve (81.5%) were used through the transfemoral (87.7%), subclavian (3.0%), transapical (8.6%), or transaortic approach (0.7%). At baseline, women had higher aortic gradients and were older. Men had more comorbidities: prior myocardial infarction, prior revascularization, prior coronary artery bypass surgery, peripheral arterial vascular disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Women had more periprocedural vascular complications in comparison to men (25.2% vs. 17.2%, p <0.001). There was no significant difference in mortality at 30-day follow up (7.6% for women vs. 8.6% for men, p=0.55). The adjusted odds ratio for one-year all-cause mortality favored women, 0.73 (95% confidence interval: 0.58 to 0.9) with mortality rate 17.3% versus 23.6% for men. Conclusions: Female sex is associated with better one-year survival after TAVI. These results suggest that TAVI might be the preferred treatment option for elderly women with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis.

AB  - Aims: In patients undergoing surgical valve replacement for severe aortic stenosis, female gender was associated with worse outcomes, not persisting after multivariable adjustment for baseline clinical differences, while contrasting data are reported about TAVI. Methods and results: From January 2007 to December 2011 all patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis undergoing TAVI at our institutions were included in the present study, and were divided into two cohorts according to their gender. All endpoints were adjudicated according to VARC definition. Three hundred and seventy-seven patients were included: 161 male and 216 female. Male patients reported higher rates of previous coronary revascularisation, while both ejection fraction and mean aortic gradient were higher in female patients. At 30 days, rates of cardiovascular death were similar (6.0% vs. 8.1%; p=0.793), while overall bleedings (44% vs. 25%; p=0.024) and life-threatening bleedings (21.1% vs. 12.7%, p=0.016) were higher in female patients, also after multivariate analysis (OR 3.44; 1.23-9.22, and OR 2.1; 1.1-4.0, CI: 95%, respectively). Major vascular complications showed a tendency to be higher in female patients (12.9% vs. 9.8%, p=0.449). At a mean follow-up of 490±250 days, no significant difference was reported between men and women for all endpoints, and after multivariate adjustment only life-threatening bleeding was reported as a predictor of death (OR 8.2:3.8-17, CI: 95%). Conclusions: TAVI can be an effective and safe strategy in high surgical risk patients, regardless of the gender; life-threatening bleedings were reported more frequently in female patients, being the only independent predictor of death. © Europa Digital and Publishing 2013.

AB  - Cardiac pathologies are the major aspect in the treatment strategies for Marfan syndrome (MFS). In this progressive disease, less is known about manifestations and progression of cardiovascular symptoms in children. To define a certain decision regarding therapeutic options, knowledge concerning the onset of cardiovascular findings is essential. From 1998 to 2011, suspected pediatric Marfan patients were subjected to a standardized diagnostic program. Cardiovascular findings were analyzed in terms of age at first clinical manifestation, prevalence and gender differences, morbidity, mortality, and treatment. Marfan syndrome was diagnosed in 82 patients (46 boys; mean age at diagnosis, 9.0 ± 5.7 years). At first presentation, aortic root dilation was found in 56 % of patients, mitral valve prolapse in 31 %, whereas pulmonary artery dilation was detected in 22 % and tricuspid valve prolapse in only 17 % of patients. Aortic (2.5 %) and mitral valve regurgitations (22 %) are significantly correlated with aortic root dilation (p < 0.01) and mitral valve prolapse (p < 0.05) but without relevant progression during childhood. Prophylactic medication was initiated for 42 % of the patients (mean age, 8.0 ± 4.5 years) because of progressive aortic root dilation. Aortic dissection did not appear. Aortic root surgery was needed for 4 % of the patients. Gender-specific differences in cardiovascular findings, progression of disease, or treatment did not appear. Comparable with adults, aortic root dilation is the most frequent cardiovascular finding in children and associated with relevant morbidity, whereas aortic and mitral valve regurgitation are of minor clinical relevance. Manifestation at an early age and slow progression of cardiovascular findings underscore the necessity of repeated echocardiographic examinations for early diagnosis and start of prophylactic treatment. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Previous data suggest women are at increased risk of death from aortic dissection. Therefore, we analyzed data from the GenTAC registry, the NIH-sponsored program that collects information about individuals with genetically triggered thoracic aortic aneurysms and cardiovascular conditions. We performed cross-sectional analyses in adults with Marfan syndrome (MFS), familial thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection (FTAAD), bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) with thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection, and subjects under 50 years of age with thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection (TAAD <50 years). Women comprised 32% of 1,449 subjects and were 21% of subjects with BAV, 34% with FTAAD, 22% with TAAD <50 years, and 47% with MFS. Thoracic aortic dissections occurred with equal gender frequency yet women with BAV had more extensive dissections. Aortic size was smaller in women but was similar after controlling for BSA. Age at operation for aortic valve dysfunction, aneurysm or dissection did not differ by gender. Multivariate analysis (adjusting for age, BSA, hypertension, study site, diabetes, and subgroup diagnoses) showed that women had fewer total aortic surgeries (OR=0.65, P<0.01) and were less likely to receive angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi; OR=0.68, P<0.05). As in BAV, other genetically triggered aortic diseases such as FTAAD and TAAD <50 are more common in males. In women, decreased prevalence of aortic operations and less treatment with ACEi may be due to their smaller absolute aortic diameters. Longitudinal studies are needed to determine if women are at higher risk for adverse events. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Background: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is an effective alternative to surgical valve replacement in symptomatic patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS). The impact of gender on outcomes remains unclear due to conflicting results in recent studies. Objective: The aim of this single center study was to describe the baseline clinical profile of male and female patients undergoing transfemoral TAVI and to evaluate the influence of gender differences on outcomes after adjusting for different baseline characteristics. Methods and Results: The study cohort consisted of 293 consecutive patients who underwent transfemoral TAVI in the Tel Aviv Medical center. A Medtronic CoreValve bioprosthesis was used in 84% of patients and an Edwards Sapien valve in 16%. Median follow-up was 480 days, with interquartile range of 330-730 days. Mortality and complication rates were examined using Cox logistic regression estimates and proportional hazards models. Mean age was 83±5.3 years. Women comprised 68% of the cohort. At baseline, men had a higher prevalence of peripheral vascular disease, heart failure, coronary heart disease, chronic atrial fibrillation and lower left ventricular ejection fraction (p<0.0001, p<0.0001, p<0.0001, p=0.049 and p<0.0001 respectively), while women were older and had smaller pre-procedural aortic valve area (p=0.04, p=0.005 respectively). Overall complication rates were similar between genders, with the exception of minor vascular complications which were more prevalent in women (p=0.05) and major arrhythmia events which were more prevalent in men (p=0.03). No significant differences in 30 days, 6 months and 1 year mortality rates were found between men and women. Adjustment for baseline differences between genders did not change the results. Conclusion: In this single center, single approach TAVI, we found no significant mortality differences between men and women despite significant differences in baseline characteristics.

AB  - Objectives: The aim of this study was to characterize aortic root dimensions of patients with aortic valve stenosis undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and to evaluate sex differences. Background: The advent of TAVR makes a precise delineation of the aortic root anatomy mandatory and requires a profound anatomic understanding. Methods: Patients planned to undergo TAVR underwent screening imaging with use of a 64-slice or dual-source electrocardiogram-gated contrast-enhanced computed tomography. Anatomic dimensions were assessed at the level of the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT), annulus, sinus of Valsalva, and ascending aorta. Results: The study population comprised 80 men and 97 women (age: 82 ± 6 years) with symptomatic severe aortic valve stenosis. Multislice computed tomography aortic root assessment revealed larger annular and LVOT dimensions in men than women (area annulus: 483.1 ± 75.6 mm2 vs. 386.9 ± 58.5 mm2, p = 0.0002; area LVOT: 478.2 ± 131.0 mm2 vs. 374.0 ± 94.2 mm2, p = 0.0024), whereas dimensions of the ascending aorta were comparable. Both LVOT and annulus were predominantly oval without sex differences, with a higher mean ellipticity index for the LVOT compared with the annulus (1.49 ± 0.2 vs. 1.29 ± 0.1); the ascending aorta was primarily circular (1.07 ± 0.1). Although similar in mean surface area, an area mismatch of annulus and LVOT of more than 10%, 20%, and 40% was detected in 42, 9, and 2 patients, respectively. The mean distance from annulus to the left coronary ostium was smaller than the mean distance of the right coronary ostium (14.4 ± 3.6 mm vs. 16.7 ± 3.6 mm), and distances were lower among women than men. Conclusions: The aortic root has specific anatomic characteristics, which affect device design, selection, and clinical outcome in patients undergoing TAVR. Female sex is associated with smaller annular and LVOT but not aortic dimensions. The degree of ellipticity as well as a significant mismatch between annular and LVOT dimensions in selected patients deserve careful evaluation. © 2013 American College of Cardiology Foundation.

AB  - Objectives: To determine the influence gender has on the configuration of ascending aortic aneurysms and their surgical treatment including early postoperative outcome. Methods: Retrospective analysis of 614 consecutive patients (173 women, 67.5 ± 9.8 years; 441 men, 63.6 ± 11.7 years) who underwent surgery for aneurysms of the ascending aorta from 2003 to 2011. Results: Women presented with larger aneurysms (57.0 ± 11.1 mm vs. 54.1 ± 8.5 mm, p = 0.013); and more frequently showed involvement of the aortic-arch (32.9% vs. 23.6%, p = 0.013), and supraaortic vessels (8.1% vs. 2.3%, p = 0.002). In men the aortic-root was more commonly affected (14.5% vs. 28.9%, p < 0.001). No differences were found in incidence and degree of aortic valve insuffiency (70.5% vs. 69.9%, p = 0.399). Aortic stenosis, however, was more common in men (39.9% vs. 49.9%, p = 0.016). Expectedly, surgery differed with hemi-arch repair in 26.2% women as compared to 16.7% in men (p = 0.006), conversely 33.3% composite (including valve) replacements in men but only 21.5% in women (p = 0.003). Operative treatment resulted in a lower 30-day-survival in women (91.7% vs. 95.9%, log-rank 4.1, p = 0.042). Logistic regression analysis indicated female sex (OR 2.18, p = 0.036), age (OR 1.64 calculated over a 5-year-time-interval, p < 0.001), arch enlargement (OR 2.54, p = 0.016), operating and cardiopulmonary bypass time (OR 1.52 and 2.17 calculated over 60-min-time-intervals, p < 0.001), total arch replacement (OR 4.19, p = 0.007), CABG (OR 2.89, p = 0.009), re-thoracotomy (OR 8.48, p < 0.001), postoperative elevated creatinine (OR 3.70, p = 0.002) and malperfusion (OR 11.96, p < 001) with a significant negative impact on 30-day-survival. Multivariate analysis demonstrated an even higher early mortality risk for female patients in comparison to male patients (30-day-mortality, adjusted for age, cardiopulmonary bypass time, re-thoracotomy and postoperative elevated creatinine, OR 3.84, 95% CI 1.29 - 11.41, p = 0.015). Conclusions: Through retrospective analysis of female and male patients with surgical treatment for aneurysms of the ascending aorta gender differences are discernible. When counseling patients, these differences have to be considered and advice modified accordingly. In women the awareness for ascending aortic disease should be heightened in order to reduce operative risk.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this prospective observational single centre study is the evaluatation of patient's gender on outcome of surgical treatment in active infective aortic valve endocarditis. Methods: Between October 1994 and January 2011, a total of 877 patients (including 669 male and 208 female patients) were treated at the Heart Centre Leipzig due to active aortic infective endocarditis (AIE) according to the Duke criteria. Gender was evaluated for having an influence on survival (Kaplan-Meier curves). Cox proportional models were used to evaluate gender differences in relation to early and up to 10-year mortality. Results: Early mortality: Early mortality among men measured 17.0% (114/669 patients). Women showed an early mortality rate of 23.6% (40/208 women, p = 0.057). Differences between female and male were found in concomitant coronary artery disease as well as diabetes mellitus, alcohol abuse and involvement of two heart valves including kissing mitral valve endocarditis. The influence for male patient according to 30-d-mortality was significant for these factors (p < 0.05). Among females, focus identification was a predictive risk factor compared to males (p < 0.05). A trend for differences was seen in additional coronary artery disease, COPD and positive blood cultures in women. Long-term mortality: Significant differences were found for arterial and pulmonary hypertension and alcohol abuse in male and not in female patients (p < 0.05). A trend was demonstrated in female patients for previous cardiac surgery, diabetes mellitus and preoperative neurological events. In men, additional to age, left ventricular function and postoperative dialysis the following factors significantly influence late mortality: diabetes mellitus, kissing mitral valve endocarditis, preoperative ventilation and alcohol abuse. Conclusions: This study is demonstrating distinct gender-based differences in patients suffering AIE and consecutively, undergoing surgical treatment. This includes disease patterns, comorbidities, intraoperative surgical treatment strategy, and long term outcome.

AB  - Objectives: This study evaluates gender differences in preoperative risk factors and the effect of gender on operative outcomes in men and women undergoing transapical aortic valve implantation. Methods: Between 4/2008 and 7/2012, 610 high-surgical-risk patients with severe aortic stenosis underwent transapical aortic valve implantation. A retrospective analysis was performed on data prospectively collected from all patients. Results: There were 371 (61%) women and 239 (39%) men. The women were older than men with a mean age of 80 ± 8 vs. 77 ± 8 years, respectively, (p < 0.001). The logistic EuroSCORE did not differ statistically (women, 36 ± 21%; men, 35 ± 23%, p = 0.68), whereas the STS mortality score differed significantly between the groups (16 ± 12 vs. 13 ± 12, respectively, p = 0.006). The women had significantly less diabetes, coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery revascularization, peripheral vascular disease and left ventricular ejection fraction < 40% but presented with significantly more severe pulmonary hypertension and reduced creatinine clearance preoperatively. Severity of the aortic stenosis was significantly greater in women. The mean aortic valve area and mean aortic valve peak gradient were 0.65 ± 0.16 cm2 and 73 ± 19 mmHg vs. 0.71 ± 0.2 cm2 and 67 ± 21 mmHg, respectively (p < 0.001). The women had significantly smaller annulus with a mean diameter of 21.3 ± 1.6 mm vs. 23.8 ± 1.9 mm (p < 0.001). Respectively, 44% of women and 9% of men received 23 mm valve and 55% and 60% 26 mm valve (p < 0.001). In 4 (1%) women but in 74 (31%) of men a 29 mm valve was implanted. At the end of the procedure, 2.9% of women and 7.5% of men experienced significant aortic regurgitation (grade >I). Paravalvular regurgitation was seen significantly more often in men than in women (38% vs. 28% p = 0.02). The 30-day mortality was 4.8% in women and 4.2% in men (p = n.s.). One year and 4 year survival was 82% and 45% in women and 80% and 49% in men, respectively. Conclusions: Despite the women being older, having higher STS mortality score, greater severity of aortic stenosis, reduced creatinine clearance and smaller annulus, gender-related early mortality and survival in follow-up after transcatheter transapical aortic valve implantation are similar. Due to smaller annulus the women have significantly lower incidence of paravalvular regurgitation than men.

AB  - Introduction: Gender-related differences in outcome of cardiovascular surgery are subject to an ongoing discussion. In octogenarians, the relation between male and female patients equalizes or may be even turn around towards more women to be operated on. This retrospective analysis tries to answer the question whether the differences in presentation, risk factors, and subsequent outcome are still present in octogenarians. Methods: 1002 patients older than 80 years with complete record in our database were evaluated. Preoperative cardiovascular risk factors, perioperative risk factors (EURO-Score, KCH-Score), operative data, and the postoperative course were analysed. A subgroup of isolated coronary artery bypass patients (CABG) was analysed separately and compared to a male and female control group aged 60 - 70 years (3816 male pts., 1060 female pts.). Analysis was done using student's t-test or the Chi-square-test if appropriate. Results: Out of 1002 patients, 427 were male (42.6%). 447 patients had isolated CABG (249 male, 56%), 249 had combined procedures (aortic/mitral valve surgery + CABG, 147 female (59%). Women presented more often with insulin-dependent diabetes (12.7% vs. 8%, p < 0.01) and higher cholesterol levels (209 ± 45 vs. 187 ± 43, p < 0.05). Women also had a higher incidence of aortic valve disease (61.3% vs. 40%, p = 0.01). Whereas the incidence of insulin dependent-diabetes was lower in octogenarian men compared to men aged 60 - 70 years (6.1% vs. 10.4%, p = 0.01), the correspondent numbers for female patients did not differ (19% vs. 17%, p > 0.05). Perioperative mortality was higher in women (6.4% vs. 4.9%, p < 0.05), but this was mainly due to the higher numbers of combined procedures; analysing isolated CABG-procedures, perioperative mortality was similar in men and women (3.2% vs. 3.9%, p = 0.1). In the younger control groups, however, women had a higher perioperative mortality also for isolated CABG (1.9% vs. 1%, p = 0.01). Conclusions: With increasing age, gender differences regarding comorbidities and relative patient numbers decrease resulting in equalized perioperative mortality rates in isolated CABG patients. The metabolic syndrome, especially the insulin dependent diabetes, remains more frequent in women and still affects outcome.

AB  - Aims: Significant differences in clinical presentation and outcomes among gender have been demonstrated in patients undergoing coronary bypass surgery. In isolated aortic replacement however, it is controversial if female gender truly influences early and late mortality. Aim: To evaluate gender related differences in clinical presentation and mortality in patients undergoing isolated surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR). Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of all patients undergoing SAVR from 2001 to 2011 in our centre. Patient demographics and clinical outcomes were prospectively entered into a dedicated database. We compared baseline characteristics, procedural characteristics, and postoperative morbidity and mortality at 30-day and 12 years follow-up among genders. Kaplan-Meier survival curves and the log-rank test were used to analyse long-term survival. Predictors for 30-day and late mortality were identified using a Cox Proportion regression model. Results: 2197 patients were included, 1290 (58.7%) male patients and 907 (41.3%) female patients. Female patients were older (70 ± 11 vs. 64 ± 13 years, p < 0.001), presented with higher Logistic EuroScore (7.5 ± 5.8 vs. 5.6 ± 6%, p = 0.006) and lower NYHA class III or IV (71 vs. 65%, p = 0.05). Male patients presented more often with LV dysfunction (EF< 35%) (7.5 vs. 2.8%, p < 0.001) and endocarditis (4.1 vs. 1.7%, p < 0.001) than female patients. Female patients were more likely to undergo complete sternotomy (65 vs. 52%, p < 0.001) and replacement with a bioprosthesis (87 vs. 78%, p < 0.001) than males. Postoperatively, female patients experienced more respiratory insufficiency (14.4 vs. 10.3%, p = 0.001) and required intra-aortic balloon pump support (1.2 vs. 0.4%, p = 0.02) than male patients. Female patients exhibited an unadjusted higher 30-day mortality (4.4 vs. 1.6%, p < 0.001) and late mortality (13 vs. 9.6%) as compared to male patients. After adjustment for baseline characteristics, only age emerged as independent predictor of late mortality (HR 1.07, 95% CI 1.03 - 1.1, p < 0.001). Conclusion: Female gender was associated with higher 30-day and late mortality after isolated aortic valve replacement. Age was the only independent predictor of late mortality in patients undergoing isolated SAVR.

AB  - Background: Female sex is associated with adverse outcomes following conventional aortic valve replacement. We investigate gender differences following transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) in the UK's National Institute for Cardiovascular Outcomes Research (NICOR) TAVI Registry. Methods: Retrospective analysis of 1627 patients enrolled in a UK multicentre registry from January 2007 to December 2010. TAVI was conducted via transfemoral, transapical, subclavian/transaxillary and transaortic access routes with implantation of Medtronic CoreValve ReValving System®, Edwards SAPIENTM and SAPIEN XTTM devices. Results: TAVI was performed in 756 (46.5%) females and 871 (53.5%) males aged 82.6±6.8 years and 80.8±7.6 years respectively. Females had a higher peak aortic gradient (84.4±28.6mmHg v 76.6±24.5mmHg; p<0.001) and smaller aortic annulus diameter (21.1±2.8mm v 23.0±3.1mm; p<0.001). Men had greater prevalence of type II diabetes (23.9% v 19.2%; p=0.021), poor left ventricular systolic function (11.9% v 5.5%; p<0.001), three vessel coronary artery disease (19.4% v 9.2%; p<0.001), left main stem disease (8.0% v 3.2%; p<0.001), previous myocardial infarction (29.5% v 13.0%; p<0.005), peripheral vascular disease (32.4% v 23.3%; p<0.001) and higher logistic EuroSCORE (21.8±14.2% v 21.0±13.4%; p=0.046). Kaplan-Meier mortality at 30 days was 6.3% (95% CI 4.3% to 7.9%) in women and 7.4% (5.6% to 9.2%) in men. At 6 months, 14.1% (11.5% to 16.7%) and 16.6% (14.0% to 16.6%) respectively. At 1 year 21.9% (18.7% to 25.1%) and 22.4% (19.4% to 25.4%) respectively. There was no difference in mortality: p=0.331 by log-rank test; hazard ratio for women 0.911 (0.754 to 1.100). There was no difference in device success rate (96.6% in women v 96.4% in men; p=0.889) or cerebrovascular event rate at 30 days (3.8% v 3.7%; p=0.962). However, women had significantly more major vascular complications than men (7.5% v 4.2%; p=0.004). Conclusions: Despite a higher risk profile in males there was no difference in mortality, procedural success or cerebrovascular event rate between genders. However, women had almost twice the rate of major vascular complications compared with men.

AB  - Background: Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI) has emerged as novel treatment option in high-risk patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis. The purpose of the present study was to determine differences in gender in terms of baseline characteristics as well as procedural and clinical outcomes among patients with severe aortic stenosis undergoing TAVI. Methods: Between July 2007 and September 2010, a total of 256 high-risk patients with severe aortic stenosis were prospectively included in a single-center registry. Patients underwent TAVI using transfemoral or transapical access with the use of both CE approved devices, the Edwards Sapien and Medtronic Corevalve prosthesis, depending on anatomic and technical requirements. Results: Out of 256 patients, 112 patients were male (44%) and 144 patients (56%) female. Females were older (84±5 vs. 81±7 p=0.01) presented with a smaller body surface area (1.7±0.2 vs. 1.9±0.2 p<0.01) and were less likely to have hypercholesterolemia (54% vs. 68%, p=0.03), coronary artery disease (54% vs. 80%, p<0.01), prior coronary artery bypass graft surgery (9% vs. 37%, p<0.01) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (25% vs. 13%, p=0.022). Baseline echocardiographic assessment revealed smaller aortic valve area (0.49±0.2cm2 vs. 0.65±0.3 cm2 p<0.01) in female patients but a similar ejection fraction (52.3±16 vs. 49.1±15 p=ns). Preoperative risk assessment by means of the logistic EuroScore showed no differences (24.8%±15 vs. 24.7%±15 p=ns), whereas the STS risk score predicted a higher mortality (7.0%±5 vs.5.7%±5 p=0.034) among female patients. Follow up assessment at 30days demonstrated no difference in clinical outcome in terms of 30-day mortality (5.4% vs. 7.6%, p=ns), stroke (5.4% vs. 2.8%, p=ns), RIFLE stage 3 kidney injury (3.6% vs. 3.5%, p=ns) and life-threatening bleeding (12.5% vs. 10.4%, p=ns) between both groups. The VARC combined safety endpoint occurred among 22.3% male and 18.1% female patients (p=ns). Conclusions: Although there are important differences in baseline clinical characteristics between male and female patients undergoing TAVI, short-term clinical outcome is similar in terms of mortality and the VARC composite safety endpoint.

AB  - In clinical studies, myocardial remodeling in aortic valve stenosis appears to be more favorable in women than in men, even after menopause. In the present study, we assessed whether circulating androgens contribute to a less favorable myocardial remodeling under pressure overload in males. We examined sex-related differences in one-year-old male and female mice. Whereas male mice at this age exhibited circulating androgen levels within the normal range for young adults, the circulating estrogens in females were reduced. The contribution of gonadal androgens to cardiac remodeling was analyzed in a group of same-age castrated mice. Animals were subjected to transverse aortic constriction (TAC). Echocardiography was performed 2 weeks after TAC and myocardial mRNA levels of TGF-βs, Smads 2 and 3, collagens, fibronectin, β-myosin heavy chain and α-myosin heavy chain were determined by q-PCR. Protein detection of p-SMAD2/3 was performed by Western Blot. Histological staining of fibrosis was performed with picrosirius red and Masson's trichrome. Compared with females, males developed more severe tissue fibrosis, LV dilation and hemodynamic dysfunction. TAC-males showed higher myocardial expression levels of TGF-βs and the treatment with a neutralizing antibody to TGF-β prevented myocardial fibrosis development. Orchiectomy diminished TAC-induced up-regulation of TGF-βs and TGF-β target genes, and it also reduced fibrosis and hemodynamic dysfunction. The capability of androgens to induce TGF-β expression was confirmed in NIH-3T3 fibroblasts and H9C2 cardiomyocytes exposed to dihydrotestosterone. Our results indicate that circulating androgens are responsible for the detrimental effects in the myocardium of older male mice subjected to pressure overload through a mechanism involving TGF-βs.

AB  - Transarterial aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is a promising method for the treatment of high-risk patients with aortic stenosis. Because gender differences are known in aortic stenosis, the aim of this study was to compare procedural and short-term outcomes, left ventricular remodeling, and inflammatory status after TAVI in men and women. One hundred consecutive patients (42 men, 58 women) who underwent transfemoral TAVI (CoreValve in 83%, SAPIEN in 17%) were prospectively analyzed. Aortic stenosis severity was higher in women (mean valve area 0.7 ± 0.3 vs 0.8 ± 0.2 cm2). Women had better ejection fractions, smaller end-diastolic and end-systolic diameters, and more concentric hypertrophy at baseline. There were no differences in device success rate (99%), 30-day total mortality (2.4% in men, 3.4% in women), stroke (2.4% in men, 1.7% in women), or pacemaker rate (26.2% in men, 15.5% in women). Periprocedural complications and 3-month outcome were not different between the genders. After TAVI, regression of hypertrophy occurred in men and women, but improvement of the ejection fraction was significant only in women. N-terminal proB-type natriuretic peptide decreased to similar levels in the 2 genders. C-reactive protein and interleukin-6, elevated at baseline more in men than in women, decreased after TAVI and normalized at 3 months only in women. In conclusion, women clinically benefit from TAVI to a degree similar to that of men. However, there are gender differences involving the recovery response of the left ventricle after TAVI. © 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The aim of this study was to examine sex differences in outcome after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) with real-world data from 2 large centers in Canada. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement is an effective alternative to surgical valve replacement in symptomatic patients with severe aortic stenosis, but the impact of sex on outcomes remains unclear. The PARTNER (Placement of Aortic Transcatheter Valves) 1A trial demonstrated greater benefit of TAVR over surgery in women, but whether this was due to the poorer surgical outcome of women or better TAVR outcome, compared with men, is unknown. Consecutive patients (n = 641) undergoing TAVR in Vancouver and Quebec City, Canada, were evaluated. Differences in all-cause mortality were examined with Kaplan-Meier estimates, adjusted logistic regression, and proportional hazards models. Women comprised 51.3% of the cohort. Balloon-expandable valves were used in 97% of cases, with transapical approach in 51.7 % women and 38.1% men. Women had more major vascular complications (12.4% vs. 5.4%, p = 0.003) and borderline significantly more major/life-threatening bleeds (21.6% vs. 15.8%, p = 0.08). At baseline, women had higher aortic gradients and worse renal function but better ejection fractions. Men had more comorbidities: prior myocardial infarction, prior revascularization, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The adjusted odds ratio for 30-day all-cause mortality favored women, 0.39 (95% confidence interval: 0.19 to 0.80; p = 0.01), and this benefit persisted for 2 years, hazard ratio 0.60 (95% confidence interval: 0.41 to 0.88; p = 0.008). Female sex is associated with better short- and long-term survival after TAVR. Added to the PARTNER 1A findings, these results suggest TAVR might be the preferred treatment option for elderly women with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis. © 2012 American College of Cardiology Foundation.

AB  - Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is an effective alternative to surgical valve replacement in symptomatic patients with severe aortic stenosis. However, the impact of sex on outcomes remains unclear, especially given the PARTNER 1A evidence of greater benefit of TAVI over surgery in women. Whether this result is due to women's poorer surgical outcome or better TAVI outcome, compared to men, is unknown. We examined sex differences in mortality after TAVI in 2 high volume centres in Canada. Methods: 641 consecutive patients undergoing TAVI in Vancouver and Quebec City, Canada were evaluated. Differences in all-cause mortality were examined using Kaplan-Meier estimates, adjusted logistic regression and proportional hazards models. Results: Females comprised 51.3% of the cohort. Balloon-expandable valves were used in 97% of cases with a transapical approach in 51.7% of females and 38.1% of males. The adjusted odds ratio for 30-day all-cause mortality favoured women, 0.39 (95% CI: 0.19, 0.80; p=0.01), and this benefit persisted for one year, hazard ratio 0.54 (95% CI 0.35,0.82; p <0.01). Major vascular complications were significantly more in females (12.4%, 5.4%,p<0.01) and borderline more major/life-threatening bleeds (21.6%, 15.8%, p =0.08). At baseline, females had higher aortic gradients and worse renal function, but better ejection fractions. Males had more comorbidities: prior MI, prior revascularization, COPD, and coronary artery disease. (Figure presented) Conclusions: Female sex is associated with better short- and mid-term survival after TAVI. These results coupled with PARTNER 1A findings suggest TAVI may be the preferred treatment for elderly females with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis.

AB  - Background: In patients with aortic stenosis, pressure overload induces cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis. Female sex influences cardiac remodeling and fibrosis in animal models. However, sex differences in hypertrophy regression after aortic valve replacement have not yet been studied. Methods: We prospectively performed echocardiography before and 2 weeks, 3 and 6 months after operation in 47 patients, 28 women and 19 men, undergoing aortic valve replacement for isolated aortic stenosis. Results: Preoperatively, women and men had similar ejection fraction (56 and 59%) and left ventricular mass (142 and 148 g/m2). Postoperatively, there was no difference in effective valvular orifice area index, mean transvalvular pressure gradient between men and women. Two weeks after operation, increased LV mass persisted in men (131 g/m2) although LV hypertrophy in women (119 g/m2) regressed to the similar level of 6 months (121 g/m2). LV mass in men was similar to those in women in 6 months after operation. (Figure Presented) Conclusion: Women adapt to pressure overload quickly than men, while men caught up to women in 6 months after operation.

AB  - Aims: Aortic sthenosis, the most common valvular desease in last years, is characterised by patho-physiological gender differences; moreover studies demonstrate a greater post-operative morbility for female patients who underwent surgical replacement of this valve. Even though subgroup analyses of some randomised trials on percutaneous valve implantation show a better outcome for females at one year, there remains a substantial lack of data about gender differences in patients undergoing TAVI. Methods and results: Our institutions included in this study all patients evaluated from January 2007 to December 2011 for severe aortic stenosis and undergoing TAVI because they were considered high surgical risk, or had a contraindication to surgery. These patients were divided into 2 cohorts according to their gender. We established primary and secondary outcomes according to VARC statements. 377 patients were included: 161 male and 216 female. Male reported higher rates of previous coronary revascularisation, while both ejection fraction and mean aortic gradient were higher in female patients. The Most frequent approach was the transfemoral one, without differences between groups. At thirty-day follow-up bleeding complications, particular life threatening bleeding, were more frequent in female patients (21.1% vs. 12.7%, p=0.016), but there were no differences according to VARC mortality for any cause mortality or cardiovascular death. At a mean follow up of 490±250 days, cardiovascular mortality seems to be higher for males, but this finding doesn't reach statistical significance (10.8% vs. 18.8%, p=0.071) and also stroke incidence was similar between groups (4.2% vs. 1.9%, p=0.211). Conclusions: TAVI can be an effective and safe strategy in high-surgical-risk patients, regardless the gender. Although not significant, men showed higher risk of death, while life threatening bleedings were reported more frequently in female patients.

AB  - Aims: We aimed to investigate the existence of sex-based differences in outcomes following transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). Methods and results: This is a prospective, multicenter, registry enrolling symptomatic patients undergoing TAVI using the 18-F Medtronic CoreValve (Medtronic, Minneapolis, Minnesota) or the Edwards SAPIEN™/SAPIEN™ XT prosthesis. A total of 676 consecutive patients (median age 83 yrs, 25th-75th percentile 79-86 yrs), 363 (54%) women underwent TAVI in five centers. Transfemoral approach was used in 575 (85.6%) patients, while a subclavian approach was employed in the remainder. The CoreValve prosthesis was implanted in 628 (92.9%) cases, and the Edwards valve prosthesis in the remainder. Women were almost 1-year older than men (median age 84 yrs vs. 83 yrs, p=0.003), had a similar prevalence of hypertension and diabetes compared to men, while presented less frequently coronary artery disease (44.9% vs. 56.2%, p=0.003) and peripheral vascular disease (24.8% vs. 35.1%, p=0.003), with a tendency toward less chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (16.4% vs. 21.9%, p=0.11). Logistic EuroSCORE was similar in the two groups (median 18.2 in women vs. 18.1 in men, p=0.95). Procedural success was similar in women as compared to men (97.2% vs. 96.2%, p=0.44). After a median follow up of 180 days, all-cause death and cardiovascular death rates were numerically lower among women than in men, however these differences did not reach the statistical significance (14.3% in women vs. 18.2% in men, logrank p=0.14 for all-cause death; 9.1% in women vs. 11.8% in men, logrank p=0.29, for cardiovascular death). No significant difference was found between the two groups with respect to myocardial infarction (0.8% in women vs. 0.3% in men, p=0.63), stroke (1.4% in women vs. 2.9% in men, p=0.19), post-procedure pacemaker implantation (15.1% in women vs. 16.3% in men, p=0.65). However, women, as compared to men, developed a higher rate of major bleedings (24.9% vs. 17.7%, p=0.025), and underwent blood transfusions more often than men (39.9% vs. 31.6%, p=0.025). Conclusions: Women, as compared to men, experience more often major bleedings following TAVI. No other significant differences in main clinical outcomes between women and men were observed in this registry.

AB  - Aims: Gender differences in patients undergoing surgical aortic valve replacement are well documented. Whether gender differences exist in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is unknown. The aim of this study is to investigate for gender differences in baseline characteristics and clinical outcomes in patients undergoing TAVI for severe aortic valve stenosis. Methods and results: From June 2007 to June 2010, we enrolled 333 consecutive patients who underwent Medtronic CoreValve implantation. Baseline characteristics and clinical outcomes were prospectively entered into a dedicated database and differences between genders were investigated. The primary end-point consisted of a composite outcome of 1-year mortality. Differences in survival outcomes between genders were estimated by Kaplan-Meier survival curves. Of the 333 patients enrolled, 152 (46%) were male and 181 (54%) were female. Males had a larger body surface area (1.93±0.17 vs. 1.6±0.16 m2, p=<0.001), left ventricular end-diastolic dimensions (51.5±7.7 vs. 45.07±7 mm, p<0.001) and aortic annulus size (25±1.04 vs. 22.6±1.5 mm, p<0.001) than females. As compared to males, females were characterised by higher transaortic mean gradient (49.7±17.7 vs. 45±16 mmHg, p=0.013). Males were more likely to have coronary artery disease (61.2 vs. 44.7%, p=0.003) and previous history of coronary artery bypass surgery (28.3 vs. 6.6%, p<0.001), more peripheral arterial disease (28 vs. 10.5%, p<0.001), higher baseline creatinine levels (1.36±0.5 vs. 1.07±0.47 mg/dl, p=<0.001), lower ejections fraction ≤35% (25.6 vs. 11.8%, p<0.001), and higher logistic EuroSCORE (21.4±14.4 vs. 17.4±10.7%, p=0.007). A 26-mm CoreValve was implanted in 62% of females and a 29-mm CoreValve in 79% in males. Kaplan-Meier survival analyses did not demonstrate any differences between genders with regards to 30-day or 1-year mortality. Males were more likely to require post-implant dilation (29 vs. 17%, p=0.011) for significant paravalvular aortic regurgitation whereas females had a higher occurrence of post-procedural pericardial effusions >1cm (4.4 vs. 0%, p=0.009). Females tended to experience a higher incidence of stroke than males (4.2 vs. 0.7%, p=0.06). Conclusions: In the current study, males undergoing TAVI had more comorbidities and higher logistic EuroSCORES than females. There were no significant differences in 30-day or 1-year mortality between genders.

AB  - Aims: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is now an alternative to surgical valve replacement in high risk patients with severe aortic stenosis. However, it is unclear whether women and men benefit equally from this therapy. The aim of this pre-specified sub-analysis was to study gender differences in 30-day outcomes following Medtronic CoreValve (MCV) implantation. Methods and results: The ADVANCE study is a fully monitored, single-arm, international multicenter trial evaluating the acute and long-term results of MCV implantation in a large “real world” patient population in highly experienced centers (>40 TAVI before joining the trial). High risk patients with severe aortic stenosis in which MCV implantation was considered feasible by the Heart Team were included. All primary endpoint-related events were fully adjudicated according to the recently released Valve Academic Research Consortium (VARC) definitions by an independent Clinical Events Committee. Between March 2010 and July 2011, a total of 1015 patients (Logistic EuroSCORE 20±13%) with severe aortic stenosis were included in the trial. Gender distribution was equal with 51% of the patients being female (N=514) and 49% male (N=501). Women and men did not differ with regard to the occurrence of porcelain aorta (4.3 vs. 3.8%), atrial fibrillation (33.2 vs. 32.6%), cerebrovascular disease (10.9 vs. 15%), and insulin or non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (13.1 and 17.4% vs. 11.0 and 21.0%). However, female patients were significantly older (82.2±6.0 vs. 79.9±6.7 years, p<0.001) and tended to be more symptomatic with 83.2% female vs. 76.4% male in NYHA class III and IV. In contrast, coronary disease was less prevalent in women (46 vs. 70%) and women were less often on clopidogrel or acetylsalicylic acid (71 vs. 79%, p<0.01) and statins (51 vs. 60%, p<0.01). MCV implantation effectively increased the aortic valve orifice area accompanied by a decline in mean aortic valve gradient in both men and women. There were no significant differences in all-cause mortality (4.6 in women vs. 4.5% in men), cardiac mortality (2.0 vs. 2.5%), cardiac reinterventions (1.0 vs. 1.9%) and MACCE (9.0 vs. 7.2%). The rate of all neurological events according to VARC was low at 3.2% in the entire cohort; the rate of stroke was 2.9%. However, female patients had a significantly higher rate of neurological events (4.6 vs. 1.8%, p=0.015) primarily driven by the higher rate of strokes (4.4 vs. 1.4%, p=0.006). These differences remained statistically significant with an Odds Ratio of 2.38 (1.06 - 5.35) after correction for differences in baseline variables. Conclusions: This analysis of the ADVANCE trial clearly demonstrates that women and men of a “real world” TAVI population differ with regard to several baseline characteristics. In these high-risk patients, TAVI can be performed with low MACCE, 30 day mortality and bleeding rates, which did not differ between women and men. An ongoing analysis will be undertaken to explain the higher rate of neurological events in women.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There is a rich literature on differences in process and outcomes for women versus men undergoing coronary revascularization. Much less is known about gender differences for patients undergoing valve replacement surgery. HYPOTHESIS: Extrapolating from revascularization, women undergoing aortic valve replacement (AVR) for aortic stenosis would have greater severity of illness, more comorbidities and worse outcomes than men. METHODS: From our Northern New England Cardiac Surgery Registry we identified 4133 patients who underwent AVR for severe stenosis (area <1.0 cm2) between 1/1/2000-12/31/2010; 2144 isolated AVRs and 1969 AVR+CABG. We compared severity of illness, comorbidities, the process of care, and in-hospital outcomes for women versus men, stratifying by concomitant CABG, using standard statistical techniques. RESULTS: Women comprised 47.9% of AVRs and 36.4% of AVR+CABGs. In the AVR population women were older, smaller, had more symptoms of heart failure but had less renal and coronary disease. They had shorter pump runs despite being more likely to receive blood products. Outcomes were similar to those in men including mortality (3.5% v 2.2% women v men; adjusted OR 1.32, 95%CI 0.71-2.44). In the AVR+CABG population women were older, smaller, and had more hypertension but less vascular disease and multivessel coronary disease. Again, pump runs were shorter but the use of blood products was greater. Mortality was higher for women than men (7.5% women v 3.8% men; adjusted OR 2.12, 95%CI 1.32-3.43) with no difference in other outcomes. CONCLUSION: In-hospital outcomes for women undergoing isolated AVR are comparable to those in men. However, as with isolated CABG, AVR+CABG is associated with higher mortality for women than for men. Why this is true remains to be determined. (Table Presented).

AB  - Objectives: The purpose of this study was to clarify the impact of sex-related differences in transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) for high-risk patients with severe aortic stenosis. Background: Although TAVI is becoming a mature technique, the impact of sex differences remains unclear. Methods: The TAVI patients were included prospectively in a dedicated database from October 2006. The proportion of women (n = 131) was similar to that of men (n = 129). The Edwards valve (85.4%) and CoreValve (14.6%) were used through the transfemoral (65.0%), subclavian (3.1%), or transapical (31.9%) approach. All events were defined according to Valve Academic Research Consortium criteria. Results: Age was similar (83.1 ± 6.3 years), but women had less coronary and peripheral disease, less previous cardiac surgery, higher ejection fraction, and lower EuroSCORE (European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation [22.3 ± 9.0% vs. 26.2 ± 13.0%, p = 0.005]). Minimal femoral size (7.74 ± 1.03 mm vs. 8.55 ± 1.34 mm, p < 0.001), annulus size (20.9 ± 1.4 vs. 22.9 ± 1.7 mm, p < 0.001), and valve size (23.9 ± 1.6 mm vs. 26.3 ± 1.5 mm, p < 0.001) were smaller in women. Device success was similar (90.8% vs. 88.4%, p = 0.516) despite more frequent iliac complications (9.0% vs. 2.5%, p = 0.030). Residual mean aortic pressure gradient (11.6 ± 4.9 vs. 10.9 ± 4.9, p = 0.279) was also similar. The 1-year survival rate was higher for women, 76% (95% confidence interval: 72% to 80%), than for men, 65% (95% confidence interval: 60% to 69%); and male sex (hazard ratio: 1.62, 95% confidence interval: 1.03 to 2.53, p = 0.037) was identified as a predictor of midterm mortality by Cox regression analysis. Conclusions: Female sex is associated with better baseline clinical characteristics and improved survival, and is identified as a predictor of midterm survival after TAVI. © 2012 American College of Cardiology Foundation.

By multivariate analysis, male gender (HR 1.798: 1.004-3.215, p=0.048), previous cardiac surgery (HR 2.299: 1.219-4.336, p=0.010), post-procedural aortic regurgitation (HR 2.261: 1.308-3.909, p=0.004), Transfusion (HR 2.474: 1.319-4.640, p=0.005), acute kidney injury (HR 6.907: 3.085-15.465, p<0.001), and conversion to surgery (HR 5.147: 1.428-18.550, p=0.012) were identified as the predictors for long-term mortality. Conclusions: Female patients have better baseline clinical characteristics and better survival, and are also identified as an independent predictor of longterm survival in the TAVI cohort.

AB  - Introduction. In patients undergoing surgical valve replacement female gender was associated with worse outcomes, not persisting after multivariate analysis. No data are present about gender differences in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). Methods. From January 2007 to December 2011 all patients with severe symptomatic AS consecutively undergoing TAVI at our Institutions were included in the present study, and were divided into 2 cohorts according to their gender. Primary and secondary end-points were defined according to the VARC statement. Results. 377 patients were included; 161 male and 216 female. Male reported higher rates of previous coronary revascularization, while both ejection fraction and mean aortic gradient were higher in female patients: in both groups transfemoral approach was the most frequent. At short term follow-up, rates of cardiovascular death were similar (4.2 vs 4.4%; p=0.793), while life threatening bleedings were more frequent in female patients (21.1 vs 12.7%, p=0.016) At a median follow up of 490±250 days, rates of cardiovascular death were similar (10.8 vs 18.8%, p=0.071) as stroke incidence (4.2 vs 1.9%, p=0.211). Para-prosthetic aortic valve insufficiency was more frequent in female patients, although not reaching statistical significance (64.4 vs 58.8%, p=0.088). Conclusions. TAVI can be an efficacious and safe strategy both in male and female patients; although not significant men showed higher risk of death, while life threatening bleedings were reported more frequently in female patients.

AB  - Background: Gender differences in patients undergoing surgical aortic valve replacement are well documented. Whether gender differences exist in patients undergoing TAVI is unknown. Methods: From June 2007 to June 2010, we enrolled 333 consecutive patients who underwent Medtronic CoreValve implantation. Baseline characteristics and clinical outcomes were prospectively entered into a dedicated database and differences between genders were investigated. The primary end-point consisted of a composite outcome of 1-year mortality.Differences in survival outcomes between genders were estimated by Kaplan-Meier survival curves. Results: 152 (46%) were male and 181 (54%) were female. Males had a larger left ventricular end-diastolic dimensions (51.5 ± 7.7 vs. 45.07 ± 7 mm, p<0.001) and aortic annulus size (25 ± 1.04 vs. 22.6 ± 1.5 mm, p<0.001) than females. Females were characterized by higher transaortic mean gradient(49.7 ± 17.7 vs. 45 ± 16 mmHg, p= 0.013). Males were more likely to have coronary artery disease (61.2 vs. 44.7%, p= 0.003) and previous history of coronary artery bypass surgery (28 vs. 6.6%, p<0.001), more peripheral arterial disease (28 vs. 10.5%, p<0.001), higher baseline creatinine levels (1.36 ± 0.5 vs. 1.07 ± 0.47 mg/dl, p=<0.001), lower ejections fraction <35% (23.4 vs. 8.4%, p<0.001), and higher logistic EuroSCORES (21.4 ± 14.4 vs. 17.4 ± 10.7%, p= 0.007). A 26-mm CoreValve was implanted in 62% of females and a 29mm CoreValve in 79% in males. Kaplan-Meier survival analyses did not demonstrate any differences between genders with regards to 30-day or 1-year mortality. Males were more likely to require post-implant dilatation (28.6 vs. 16.9%, p= 0.011) for significant paravalvular aortic regurgitation whereas females had a higher occurrence of post-procedural pericardial effusion > 1cm (4.4 vs. 0%, p= 0.009). Conclusion: In the current study, males undergoing TAVI had more comorbidities and higher logistic EuroSCORES than females. There were no significant differences in 30-day or 1-year mortality between genders.

AB  - OBJECTIVE. The aim of this study was to analyze the gender differences in hospital outcome in postoperative cardiac surgery patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS. A retrospective longitudinal descriptive study of 362 patients admitted after cardiac surgery to the Intensive Care Unit of a third level hospital, from March 2009 to March 2011, included in the Spanish registration ARIAM (Analysis of Delay in Acute Myocardial Infarction). There were 208 men and 154 women and we analyzed in both genders: the baseline clinical-demographic characteristics, cardiovascular risk factors, comorbidities, type of surgery, treatment, cardiac surgery complications, and in-hospital mortality. RESULTS. Women were older (66.17 ± 11.03 vs. 63.73 ± 11.02, p = 0.038) and had more prevalence of obesity (39.60 vs. 27.90%, p = 0.019) and hypertension (70.10 vs. 61.50%, p = 0.090) than men, while men had greater frequency of smoking (25.00 vs. 5.20%, p<0.001) and chronic lung disease (10.20 vs. 3.30%, p = 0.012). Men had more history of previous ischemic heart disease (both AMI and angina) and women more history of heart failure, atrial fibrillation and pulmonary hypertension. There were no differences in the presence of hyperlipidemia, diabetes and chronic renal failure. The Euroscore (European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation) medium were 6.47 ± 2.52 in women y 5.13 ± 3.17 in men (p<0.001). Women have a different pattern of access to cardiac surgery: they were more likely to receive a valvular surgery (77.30 vs. 50.50%, p<0.001) while men had greater frequency of coronary revascularization surgery (43.30 vs. 16.9%, p<0.001). The aortic surgery was similar in both sexes. There were no significant differences in cardiopulmonary bypass time (113.56 ± 44.44 in men and 109.69 ± 47.47 in women) and aortic crossclamp time (77.61 ± 35.30 in men and 75.98 ± 32.99 in women). The amount of inotropic/ vasoactive drugs administered and the use of intra-aortic balloon pump were similar in both sexes. Complications of cardiac surgery (cardiogenic shock, cardiac arrest, perioperative myocardial infarction, major bleeding and renal failure) were similar for women and men. There was a non statistically significative trend to higher in-hospital mortality in women (11.00 vs. 5.80%, p = 0.068). CONCLUSIONS. Women had a worst cardiovascular profile and non statistically significative trend to higher in-hospital mortality. This difference probably is not attributable to gender, but the type of surgery, because women were more likely to receive a valve surgery, that has a higher mortality. There are no studies specifically designed to investigate possible gender differences in cardiac surgery.

AB  - Purpose: To study gender-specific adult patients operated on the heart valves and evaluation of gender differences as a factor possibly influencing hospital mortality. Methods: The study retrospectively included 1095 adult patients (aged 18) who in 2009 performed the operation on one or more valves. The analysis included 20 parameters. Data were processed using SPSS. Results: The operated women were significant at 2.5 ± 0.8 years (95% CI 0.9-3.9) P = .000 older men. Statistically significant differences between the structure of operations on the mitral and aortic valve in females and males (P = .000). Women less likely than men to perform operations on the other (aortic and/or tricuspid) valve and mitral reconstruction performed. Women are less likely than men implanted with a mechanical prosthesis. On average, men pressure gradient on the aortic valve was by 4.3 ± 6.6 mm Hg (95% CI 4.5-18.6), P = .006 compared with women. Fibrillation, atrial flutter in men recorded significantly less likely than women OR = 0.434 (95% CI 0.33-0.56), P = .000, but men more frequently detected infective endocarditis OR = 3.2 (95% CI 2.18-4.81) P = .000; hypertension OR = 1.56 (95% CI 1.18- 2.06) P = .000; myocardial infarction in the history of OR = 2.8 (95% CI 1.47-5.41) P = .001. On average, during the operation in men time duration of cardiopulmonary bypass was greater in 11.5 ± 3.6 min (95% CI 4.5-18.6), P = .002, and 8.7 ± 2.4 min (95% CI 3.9-13.4), P = .000, during aortic clamping, respectively. For such parameters as pulmonary artery pressure, left ventricular ejection fraction, end-diastolic left ventricular size, duration of treatment after the surgery, presence of CAD, diabetic, operations with extracorporeal circulation in the history of implanted pacemaker proceeds to significant differences between women and men were not identified. Conclusions: Among adult patients undergoing surgery of heart valves (in combination with or without correction of concomitant cardiac pathology) demonstrated significant gender differences in age, the pressure gradient on the aortic valve, the structure of operations on heart valves, the incidence of atrial fibrillation, infective endocarditis, hypertension, myocardial infarction in history, time of cardiopulmonary bypass and aortic clamping time.

AB  - Aims: The aim of this study is to investigate gender differences in baseline characteristics and clinical outcomes in patients undergoing TAVI for severe aortic valve stenosis. Methods and results: From June 2007 to June 2010, we enrolled 333 consecutive patients who underwent Medtronic CoreValve implantation. Baseline characteristics and clinical outcomes were prospectively entered into a dedicated database and differences between genders were investigated. The primary end-point consisted of a composite outcome of 1-year mortality. Differences in survival outcomes between genders were estimated by Kaplan-Meier survival curves.Of the 333 patients enrolled, 152 (46%) were male and 181 (54%) were female. Males had a larger body surface area (1.93±0.17 vs. 1.6±0.16 m2, p=<0.001), left ventricular end-diastolic dimensions (51.5±7.7 vs. 45.07±7 mm, p<0.001) and aortic annulus size (25±1.04 vs. 22.6±1.5 mm, p<0.001) than females. As compared to males, females were characterised by higher peak (82±26.8 vs. 73.5±24 mmHg, p=0.003) and mean (49.7±17.7 vs. 45±16 mmHg, p=0.013) transvalvular aortic valve gradients. Males were more likely to have coronary artery disease (61.2 vs. 44.7%, p=0.003) and previous history of coronary artery bypass surgery (28 vs. 6.6%, p<0.001), more peripheral arterial disease (28 vs. 10.5%, p<0.001), higher baseline creatinine levels (1.36±0.5 vs. 1.07±0.47 mg/dl, p=<0.001), lower ejections fraction <35% (23.4 vs. 8.4%, p<0.001), and higher logistic EuroSCORES (21.4±14.4 vs. 17.4±10.7%, p=0.007). A 26-mm CoreValve was implanted in 62% of females and a 29-mm CoreValve in 79%. Kaplan-Meier survival analyses did not demonstrate any differences between genders with regards to 30-day or 1-year mortality. Males were more likely to require post-implant dilatation (28.6 vs. 16.9%, p=0.011) for significant paravalvular aortic regurgitation whereas females had a higher occurrence of post-procedural pericardial effusion> 1 cm (4.4 vs. 0%, p=0.009). No significant differences were observed in the need for permanent pacemaking between genders (p=0.24). Conclusions: In the current study, males undergoing TAVI had more comorbidities and higher logistic EuroSCORES than females. There were no significant differences in 30-day or 1-year mortality between genders.

AB  - Background: The use of small aortic valve prostheses has been shown to increase mortality and morbidity. We noticed that in many studies women received smaller prostheses in relation to body surface area, resulting in higher frequencies of “patient prosthesis mismatch” (PPM). As this imbalance may impact on outcome data, we sought to evaluate gender differences in size of aortic prostheses in relation to patients' anatomy. Methods: 361 consecutive patients who underwent aortic valve replacement were analyzed. Size and type of prostheses were compared in relation to patients' sex, height, weight, and left ventricular outflow tract size (LVOT). Results: Male patients received larger prostheses (P = 0.0233), even if they were of equal height and had equally wide LVOTs. Consequently, PPM was substantially more frequent in females (63% vs 41%, P < 0.0001). A significant increase in prosthetic size with increasing height was only observed in men (P = 0.032). The decrease of prosthetic size with age (P = 0.0007) is explained by a higher rate of biological valves with smaller EOAs in older patients. Despite the longer mean life expectancy of women, they were more often provided with bioprostheses up to the age of 70 years (P = 0.020). Conclusion: We observed that irrespective of height and LVOT size, male patients are provided with larger aortic valve prostheses than women. This observation is in concordance with a higher incidence of PPM in women in many published series. As such, an imbalance may significantly affect outcome data it should be considered in future studies, by separately analyzing male and female patients.

AB  - Background: Patient gender can affect the clinical manifestations of coronary artery disease (CAD) and clinician interpretation of the symptoms and results of exercise stress tests for management decisions. This may be true also for aortic stenosis (AS), given its many shared features with CAD and similar symptom-based management. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of gender on the assessment of severe asymptomatic AS by exercise stress echocardiography (ESE). Methods: One hundred sixty patients (71 female) with severe asymptomatic AS and good left ventricular function underwent ESE for assessment of their clinical status. Eighty-three percent of the patients were followed after echocardiography for a mean of 644 ± 467 days. Findings and outcome were compared between men and women. Results: There were no gender differences in mean age, baseline and peak exercise heart rates and blood pressures, aortic valve area, and prevalence of coronary artery disease. Female patients had a lower exercise capacity (shorter exercise time, lower exercise load), but there were no significant between-group differences in the exerciserelated parameters defining AS. Thirty-five women (49.3%) and 37 men (41.5%) were treated by aortic valve replacement (P = 0.2) within a similar time range from echocardiography (P = 0.6). Conclusions: The interpretation of the ESE test is similar in men and women with asymptomatic severe AS despite the lower exercise capacity of women. Accordingly, both genders have similar rates of aortic valve replacement on follow-up. ESE appears to be valid and gender-bias-free diagnostic tool for the assessment of asymptomatic severe AS.

AB  - Background-: In patients with aortic stenosis, pressure overload induces cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis. Female sex and estrogens influence cardiac remodeling and fibrosis in animal models and in men. Sex differences and their molecular mechanisms in hypertrophy regression after aortic valve replacement have not yet been studied. Methods and results-: We prospectively obtained preoperative and early postoperative echocardiography in 92 patients, 53 women and 39 men, undergoing aortic valve replacement for isolated aortic stenosis. We analyzed in a subgroup of 10 patients matrix gene expression in left ventricular (LV) biopsies. In addition, we determined the effect of 17β-estradiol on collagen synthesis in isolated rat cardiac fibroblasts. Preoperatively, women and men had similar ejection fraction. Similar percentages of women and men had increased LV diameters (37% and 38%). Women more frequently exhibited LV hypertrophy than men (women: 86%; men: 56%; P<0.01). Postoperatively, increased LV diameters persisted in 34% of men but only in 12% of women (P<0.023). LV hypertrophy reversed more frequently in women than in men, leading to a similar prevalence of LV hypertrophy after surgery (women: 45%; men: 36%). In surgical biopsies, men had significantly higher collagen I and III and matrix metalloproteinase 2 gene expression than women. In isolated rat cardiac fibroblasts, 17β-estradiol significantly increased collagen I and III gene expressions in male cells but decreased it in female cells. CONCLUSION-: Women adapt to pressure overload differently from men. Less fibrosis before surgery may enable faster regression after surgery. © 2010 American Heart Association, Inc.

AB  - ackground: Patients with low-flow, low-gradient aortic stenosis (AS) represent the most challenging subset of AS. We have recently shown that decreased exercise capacity and projected aortic valve area are predictors of outcome in low flow AS. Little is known about gender differences in low flow AS and their potential implications on management strategies. Methods: 142 pts with low flow AS (valve area ≤ 1.2 cm2, LV EF ≤ 40%, mean gradient ≤ 40 mmHg) underwent dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE) at study entry and assessment of functional capacity using the Duke Activity Status Index (DASI), 95 pts additionally underwent a 6-minute walk test (6MWT). Results: Only 36 (25%) pts were female. Women were slightly older (74 vs 71 years, p=0.21). Although women reported a similar symptomatic status at entry (NYHA and CCS, p=0.20 and 0.54), females had significantly worse performance at 6MWT (202±136 vs 296±130 m, p=0.008) and a lower DASI score (17±10 vs 27±15, p<0.0001). There was no difference in mean gradients, EF at rest and peak DSE, and projected valve area. Overall, 50 pts died (12 [33%] women, 38 [36%] men). Interestingly, follow up was significantly longer in males (471±420 vs 250±267 days, p=0.004). There was no difference in the rate of aortic valve replacement (f/m 47% vs. 47%), and perioperative death (f/m 24% vs. 22%). Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed a trend towards a higher mortality in women without reaching statistical significance (log rank 0.16). In pts undergoing AVR, shorter 6MWT distance predicted death only in men despite lower baseline distance in women (p=0.02). Conclusion: Although the majority of pts with degenerative AS are female, women are significantly underrepresented in the subgroup of low flow AS. Although women present with significantly worse exercise capacity as reflected by lower DASI and 6MWT, both previously associated with worse outcome in low flow AS, there was no evidence of reduced survival in women. Hence, low functional capacity should not necessarily preclude consideration of AVR in women with low flow AS.

AB  - Background: Little is known about the gender differences of patients undergoing aortic valve replacement (AVR) for isolated severe aortic stenosis. Methods and Results: 408 consecutive patients (215 women and 193 men; p=0.9) were analysed. At presentation, women were older (73.7±9.3 years vs men 66.5±11.5 years; p<0.001), more symptomatic (New York Heart Association (NYHA) class: women 2.3±0.7 vs men 2.0±0.65; p<0.001), and presented with smaller valve areas (women 0.6±0.2 cm2 vs men 0.7±0.2 cm2; p<0.001) and higher mean pressure gradients (women 67.3±19.2 mm Hg vs men 62.2±20.0 mm Hg, p=0.001). Despite older age and more advanced disease in women, operative mortality did not differ. Survival after AVR by Kaplane-Meier analysis tended to be even better in women (92.8%, 89.8%, 81.4% vs men 89.1%, 86.6%, 76.3% at 1, 2 and 5 years, p=0.31). After division into age quintiles, the outcome of women was significantly better in patients older than 79 years (p=0.005). After adjustment for clinical characteristics, gender did not predict operative mortality and late outcome. Despite physical improvement in both groups after surgery, women remained more symptomatic (NYHA class: women 1.6±0.7 vs men 1.3±0.4; p=0.001). Conclusion: Although women referred to AVR are older and more symptomatic, operative and long-term mortality are not increased. In the oldest age group of 79 years and older, women even have a better outcome, presumably due to a longer mean life expectancy.

AB  - Background: The importance of appropriate sizing of aortic valve prostheses has repeatedly been stated. In many publications, however, women on average received smaller prostheses in relation to body surface area, resulting in higher frequencies of “patient prosthesis mismatch” (PPM). As this imbalance may potentially impact on outcome data, we sought to evaluate gender differences in size and type of aortic prostheses in relation to patients' anatomy. Methods: We prospectively analysed 361 consecutive patients who underwent aortic valve replacement. Size and type of prostheses were compared in relation to patients̈ sex, height, weight and size of the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT). Results: Male patients received larger prostheses (p=0.0233), even if they were of equal height and had equally wide LVOT. Consequently, PPM was substantially more frequent in females (63% versus 41%, p<0.0001). The decrease of prosthetic size with age (p=0.0007) is explained by an increasing use of biological valves with smaller EOAs in older patients. Despite the longer mean life expectancy of women, they were more often provided with bioprostheses under the age of 71 (p=0.020). A significant increase in prosthetic size with increasing height was only observed in male patients (p=0.032) but not in females. Conclusion: We observed that irrespective of height and width of the LVOT, male patients on average are provided with larger aortic valve prostheses than women. This observation is in concordance with a higher incidence of PPM in females in many published series. As such an imbalance may significantly affect outcome data it should be considered in future studies, by separately analyzing male and female patients.

AB  - Background: Untreated severe aortic stenosis (AS) is associated with a high morbidity and mortality. A recent study of a claims database revealed women with aortic disease were half as likely as men to undergo aortic valve replacement (AVR), however severity of aortic disease was not assessed. Our aim was to determine operative rates and time to surgery in men versus women with severe AS. Methods: Our center's echocardiography database was used to identify all adult patients (pts) with severe AS in the year 2005. Baseline characteristics including time of initial diagnosis of severe AS, symptoms, valve assessment, and co-morbidities, as well as treatment and survival outcomes were obtained. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to assess probability of undergoing AVR in men vs women. To assess time to surgery, a 6 month landmark analysis was performed to exclude pts followed at outside institutions referred solely for surgery. Results: 237 pts were identified with severe AS (54% women). The overall operative rate for the cohort was 67%. After adjusting for age, mortality was significantly improved in both men and women undergoing AVR when compared to pts not undergoing AVR (Cox HR 0.34, p<0.001). 58% of women underwent AVR vs 78% of men. Men were 35% more likely to undergo AVR than women (RR 1.35, 95% CI 1.13-1.61, Fisher's exact p = 0.001). After correcting for age, symptoms, heart failure class, co-morbidities, left ventricular ejection fraction, and aortic valve area and gradients, the odds of women not undergoing AVR were 5.3-fold higher than men (logistic regression, p < 0.01). In the landmark analysis of pts operated on at least 6 months after diagnosis with severe AS, women waited 3.3 years vs 2.2 years for men (p = 0.032). This was statistically significant even after adjusting for age, symptoms, creatinine, ejection fraction, aortic valve index and gradient (p = 0.041). Conclusions: In this single center analysis of patients with severe AS, women were significantly less likely to undergo AVR than men. Women who underwent AVR waited an average of 1.1 years longer than men between initial diagnosis and surgery.

AB  - Objective: To determine whether there are sex-based differences in serum troponin I (TnI) after cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. Design: Prospective, observational, cohort study. Setting: Tertiary cardiac surgery intensive care unit (ICU) at a university hospital. Interventions: None. Measurements and Main Results: Serum TnI was measured in samples obtained at ICU admission and 6, 12, 24, and 48 hours later. A total of 761 consecutive patients were studied (444 men and 317 women). The characteristics and results of the different sex subgroups were as follows: A) Coronary bypass: 165 men and 38 women. Age, Parsonnet score, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation III score, prevalence of renal failure, intra-aortic balloon use, and the lengths of cardiopulmonary bypass, mechanical ventilation, and ICU stay were similar in the two groups. Body mass index, red-cell transfusion needs, and use of noradrenaline were significantly higher in women, whereas dobutamine requirements were higher in men. Mortality: 3 men (1.6%) vs. 0 women (p = not significant). The TnI peak was slightly, but significantly, higher in men (6.2 ± 4.9 vs. 4.5 ± 2.6 μg/L. p < 0.05). B) Valve surgery: 279 men and 279 women. Some significant differences were found: Women were older than men and had higher Parsonnet score and transfusion needs. The other recorded variables were similar. Mitral prosthesis: 62 men and 125 women (p < 0.05). Mitral valvuloplasty: 24 men, 7 women (p < 0.05). Aortic prosthesis: 162 men, 103 women (p < 0.05). Mitral and aortic prosthesis: 31 men and 44 women (p < 0.05). TnI peaks were similar for both sexes in each valve subgroup. Mortality: 3 men (1%) vs. 11 women (3.4%) (p < 0.05). The TnI peak did not reach any significant differences between sexes (men 7.9 ± 6.0 vs. 8.5 ± 6.5 μg/L in women. p = not significant). Conclusion: No clinically relevant sex-based differences were found in the TnI peaks after cardiac surgery.

AB  - Objective: The objective of this study was to assess outcome differences in aortic valve replacement based on gender. Methods: A study from a ten-year hospitalization cohort with prospective data collection was conducted. Included in the study were patients undergoing aortic valve replacement surgery between March 1997 and July 2003 (N = 406). There were 223 males and 183 females included in the study. The study examined 41 potential confounding risk factors and 16 outcome variables. Results: Univariate analysis on potential confounding risk factors revealed a significant difference between males and females on 12 factors. Co-morbid disease, hypertension, current vascular disease, aortic insufficiency, body surface area, blood added on pump, and annulus size significantly correlated with age. The correlation resulted in five confounding risk factors: age, tobacco history, obesity, left ventricular hypertrophy, and creatinine level. Logistic regression analysis found that after controlling for age, tobacco history, obesity, left ventricular hypertrophy, and creatinine level, there is no difference between males and females on outcomes following aortic valve replacement. Additionally, choice of vascular prosthesis had no impact on post-operative outcomes. Conclusion: After controlling for confounding variables, similar outcomes were observed for males and females undergoing aortic valve replacement. © 2009 Surgical Associates Ltd.

AB  - Gender influence on left ventricular (LV) remodeling associated to aortic valve stenosis (AS) has been long recognized, but underlying myocardial gene expression patterns have not been explored. We studied whether sex differences in echocardiographic LV anatomy and function in AS patients are associated with specific changes in myocardial mRNA expression of remodeling proteins. AS (n = 39) and control (n = 23) patients were assessed echocardiographically, and LV myocardial mRNA levels were quantified by PCR. AS patients exhibit increased wall thicknesses and LV mass index (LVMI), but only men show chamber dilation. Collagens and fibronectin mRNA levels increased correlatively to transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1). In AS women, collagen I upregulation was proportionally higher than other extracellular matrix (ECM) components. No changes in matrix metalloproteinase-2 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 were detected. Gene expressions of sarcomeric proteins (β-myosin heavy chain and myosin light chain-2) and TGF-β1were directly correlated with each other. Myosin light chain-2 mRNA levels increased proportionally to the transvalvular gradient, but women did so in a greater extent than men for a given gradient. In women, the hypertrophic growth response, reflected by LVMI, was proportional to the expression of genes encoding sarcomeric proteins and TGF-β1. In men, chamber dilation and deterioration of LVEF was proportional to collagens, fibronectin, and TGF-β1 gene expression levels. We evidenced gender biased gene expression patterns of the intracellular TGF-β pathways involving the Smad branch, but not the TAK-1 branch, that could contribute to the remodeling differences observed in AS men and women. Based on these findings, a gender specific therapeutic approach of pressure overload LV hypertrophy could be justified. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Aortic regurgitation (AR) and aortic stenosis (AS) cause cardiac hypertrophy characterized by changes in myocyte and extracellular matrix (ECM) biology. Experimental models of pressure and volume overload demonstrated changes in a few specific ECM proteins. However, pathophysiological differences between AR and AS hearts probably involve many genes. Method: To determine differences in AR vs AS gene expression patterns Tru-cut biopsies were obtained at the thickest portion of the LV free wall from pts undergoing aortic valve replacement for isolated, pure AS (4M, 5F) or isolated, pure AR (4M, 3F), and from “control” pts with coronary artery disease (CAD) but no infarction undergoing elective bypass grafting (4M). Labeled cRNA was used to probe Affymetrix microarrays (Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0). Data were analyzed using dCHIP and Ingenuity Pathways Analysis. Results: Comparison of RNA expression (AS vs AR, AS vs CAD, AR vs CAD) revealed relative expression excess (p1.2-fold, 557 > 1.5-fold and 112 > 2-fold. Gender differences also were seen (319 genes > 1.2 fold, 158 > 1.5-fold, 58 > 2-fold). However, most differences between AR and AS shared similar magnitude and direction for both genders. Associations were found between cardiac dimensions (LVIDd) and genes involved in extracellular matrix remodeling (MMP9 r = 0.-41, p < 0.05 and TIMP4 r = 0.-49, p,0.05). Pathways analysis revealed highly significant gene expression clusters for cell signaling, nervous system, development, and lipid metabolism Conclusion: Significant associations between LVIDd and expression of genes involved in ECM matrix remodeling suggests that, as in experimental AR/AS, wall stress is directly transduced to pathophysiological gene expression. Clustering of gene expression patterns suggests the involvement of specific pathways, whose further elucidation may reveal important therapeutic targets.

AB  - Aim: To determine whether a higher resistance of the female hypertrophied myocardium to ischemic-reperfusion injury can be seen also in clinical medicine. Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of perioperative and postoperative courses of treatment in hormonally active adult patients undergoing surgery for aortic replacement in our center from 1 January 1995 through 30 June 2004. All patients had aortic valve replacement from midline sternotomy. We were looking for any sex differences. Results: There was no intraoperative or in-hospital death. We did not find any sex differences in the length of hospital stay or the need for inotropic support. We did document a sex difference in the incidence of perioperative transient atrioventricular block of a higher degree (AVB II/III); it was present statistically significantly more often in males than in females. Conclusion: A higher resistance of the female hypertrophied myocardium to ischemia can also be seen in clinical practice.

AB  - Objective: The interface of gender and outcome after cardiac procedures is gaining increasing interest. Reports on gender differences after aortic valve replacement are rare. Up to now no data exist on this topic concerning the pulmonary autograft. Methods: Between June 1994 and July 2003, n=296 (231 male/65 female) patients were operated on the pulmonary autograft (Ross procedure) using the subcoronary or root inclusion technique due to an aortic valve disease. Patients were investigated clinically and echocardiographically to determine gender auto- and homograft valve function as well as hemodynamic variables with regard to gender-related differences. Results: Follow-up was nearly complete (99%). There were neither differences concerning reoperation rate of autograft and homograft nor differences with regard to left ventricular function or impairment of functional capacity between genders. Females were older (48±14.1 versus 44±12.9 years, p<0.05). The underlying aortic valve disease in females was primarily a combined disease or an aortic valve stenosis, in males a combined disease or an aortic valve insufficiency. Males had a higher cardiac index, stroke volume, enddiastolic diameter, left ventricular mass index and body surface area. No differences of pressure gradients across the pulmonary autograft or grade of insufficiency of the autograft or the homograft were found between gender groups. Pressure gradient across pulmonary homograft in the right ventricular outflow tract was lower in female patients. Conclusions: Although the Ross procedure provides excellent clinical results in both gender groups, there are some differences in valve function. Concerning autograft function there were no differences. Men had higher pressure gradients across the homograft in the right ventricular outflow tract. Grade of homograft insufficiency was comparable between genders. © 2006 Steinkopff-Verlag.

AB  - Objective: The present study was designed to examine psychological characteristics of adolescents and adults with operated congenital heart disease (ACHD). Particularly it was to be examined whether cardiological parameters may be associated with subjectively perceived impairments and measures of psychological distress. Patients: A total of 361 men (209) and women (152) between 14 and 45years underwent medical checkups and an interview on psychological and sociological issues. Setting: The medical part consisted of a complete cardiological examination including the classification of residual symptoms according to the New York Heart Association (NYHA), and spiroergometry. The Brief Symptom Inventory was used for depicting current psychological and somatic symptoms. These were assessed on 9 subscales: somatization, obsession-compulsion, interpersonal sensitivity, depression, anxiety, hostility, phobic anxiety, paranoid ideation, and psychoticism. Results: The analyses revealed statistically significant associations between the degree of NYHA class and psychological symptoms. These findings could not be reproduced for physical fitness as measured by peak oxygen consumption. No gender differences emerged. Conclusions: Our results suggest that psychological measures of ACHD are not directly dependent on their physical fitness or on the severity of residual symptoms. Instead, patients'subjective appraisal of their disease severity and the conviction to what degree one can depend on the operated heart may be important determinants of psychological states. © 2006 the Authors; Journal compilation © 2006 Blackwell Publishing, Inc.

TI  - Valvular heart disease in women
AU  - Tornos, P.
T2  - Revista Espanola de Cardiologia
AB  - Very few studies of valvular heart disease have been specifically carried out in women. It is well known that the prevalence of some types of valve disease is influenced by sex: rheumatic mitral stenosis is very common in women but degenerative valve disease affects both sexes similarly. A number of sex differences in the physiopathology of degenerative aortic stenosis have been reported: the degree of calcification is less in women than men and women's ventricles respond to equivalent reductions in valve area with a greater increase in gradient and greater contractility. With regard to prognosis, it is generally accepted that mortality associated with heart surgery is higher in women than men, for both coronary artery and valve surgery. The underlying reasons for the increase in mortality are not clear. Pregnancy presents particular difficulties for women with valvular heart disease. In those with significant valve lesions, it is advisable to correct the valve disease before pregnancy is considered. Anticoagulant treatment involves serious problems for pregnant women with a mechanical prosthesis. They suffer increased risks of prosthetic valve thrombosis and of fetal embryopathy if they take oral anticoagulants during the first trimester.

AB  - Background: The purpose of this study is to compare sex-specific, long-term outcomes after combined valve and coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG). Methods: Between 1990 and 2000, 1,567 patients underwent combined valve and CABG surgery at our institution. Our surgical database was linked to a governmental administrative hospital discharge database and a registry of deaths to obtain long-term follow-up. All patients underwent CABG plus aortic (62%), mitral (31%), or multiple valve surgery (7%). Results: Women had more preoperative risk factors than men (namely, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and stroke; all p < 0.001). The prevalence of triple-vessel disease was the same between men and women, but women received fewer mammary grafts and fewer total bypass grafts (both p < 0.01). Women received fewer mitral valve repairs and more mitral valve replacements than men (p = 0.014). Length of follow-up was 5.3 ± 3.2 years (mean ± SD; range, 0 to 12.5) and was 99.8% complete. Both sexes had similar long-term survival rates. Women were at higher risk of stroke during follow-up (risk ratio = 1.52, 95% confidence interval: 1.1 to 2.1). There were no sex differences in rehospitalization for acute myocardial infarction (p = 0.9), heart failure (p = 0.4), redo cardiac surgery (p = 0.5), or endocarditis (p = 0.4). Conclusions: Women have a higher preoperative risk profile than men undergoing combined valve and CABG surgery, but long-term survival rates are similar. Female sex is an independent predictor of stroke during follow-up. Further studies should focus on the cause of increased risk of stroke and methods of prevention. © 2006 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.

AU  - Fox, A.A.

T2  - Seminars in Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia
AB  - Over 410,000 cardiac surgeries are performed in American women each year. Women having coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and valve surgery do so at an older age and with more cardiovascular risk factors than men. Women's smaller body size may also increase risk by increasing the technical difficulty of surgical procedures. Female CABG patients appear to have higher perioperative mortality and cardiac morbidity, although studies of neurologic outcomes in female CABG patients have produced equivocal findings. Women undergoing CABG tend to consume more hospital resources than men do in terms of blood transfusion, mechanical ventilation, and length of intensive care unit and overall hospital stay. With regard to valve surgery, women appear to have worse outcomes than men if the surgery is combined with a CABG operation. Women and men undergoing isolated aortic valve surgery have similar mortality, but little is known about gender differences in mitral and tricuspid valve surgery outcomes. Women who require heart transplantation tend to have idiopathic cardiomyopathy rather than the ischemic cardiomyopathy that is more common in male heart transplant candidates. Although female heart transplant recipients seem to have a stronger immunologic response after transplantation, which manifests in more frequent acute rejection episodes, it is not clear whether this increases women's mortality risk. Men appear to have a greater incidence of posttransplant vasculopathy than women. Further research is needed to identify risk factors for perioperative morbidity and mortality in women undergoing cardiac surgery and to develop medical interventions to mitigate these risks.

AB  - Background: Mechanical valves and bioprostheses are widely used for aortic valve replacement. Though previous randomised studies indicate that there is no important difference in outcome after implantation with either type of valve, knowledge of outcomes after aortic valve replacement is incomplete. Objective: To predict age and sex specific outcomes of patients after aortic valve replacement with bileaflet mechanical valves and stented porcine bioprostheses, and to provide evidence based support for the choice of prosthesis. Methods: Meta-analysis of published results of primary aortic valve replacement with bileaflet mechanical prostheses (nine reports, 4274 patients, and 25 726 patient-years) and stented porcine bioprostheses (13 reports, 9007 patients, and 54 151 patient-years) was used to estimate the annual risks of postoperative valve related events and their outcomes. These estimates were entered into a microsimulation model, which was employed to calculate age and sex specific outcomes after aortic valve replacement. Results: Life expectancy (LE) and event-free life expectancy (EFLE) for a 65 year old man after implantation with a mechanical valve or a bioprosthesis were 10.4 and 10.7 years and 7.7 and 8.4 years, respectively. The lifetime risk of at least one valve related event for a mechanical valve was 48%, and for a bioprosthesis, 44%. For LE and EFLE, the age crossover point between the two valve types was 59 and 60 years, respectively. Conclusions: Meta-analysis based microsimulation provides insight into the long term outcome after aortic valve replacement and suggests that the currently recommended age threshold for implanting a bioprosthesis could be lowered further.

AB  - Objective: There are gender differences in clinical presentation, treatment and outcome of patients with coronary artery disease. We investigated whether there is also a gender difference in terms of mortality risk on the waiting list in patients accepted for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Methods: All our patients accepted for elective CABG 1995-1999 (1303 women and 4561 men) were included. Prospectively registered preoperative characteristics and mortality were compared between men and women. Hazard functions for death on the waiting list were calculated using Poisson regression. Results: At acceptance, women were older (68±9 vs 65±9 years, P<0.001), had a higher Cleveland risk score (2.4±1.8 vs 1.8±1.8, P<0.001) and a better left ventricular ejection fraction (60±14 vs 57±14%, P<0.001). More women had unstable angina pectoris (33 vs 20%, P<0.001), diabetes mellitus (23 vs 17%, P<0.001), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (8 vs 5%, P<0.001), hypertension (47 vs 37%, P<0.001) and planned concomitant aortic valve surgery (13 vs 4%, P<0.001) while more men had three vessel disease (70 vs 66%, P=0.001). Median waiting time (55 vs 54 days, P=0.19) and unadjusted mortality (1.4 vs 1.0%, P=0.25) on the waiting list did not differ significantly between men and women but in a multivariate hazard analysis, female gender was associated with a lower risk than men of death on the waiting list (risk ratio 0.42, 95% confidence interval 0.19-0.93, P=0.032). Conclusions: Women have a lower risk of death on the waiting list for CABG, in spite of more advanced age, more co-morbidity, and a higher percentage of unstable angina pectoris. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Objective: This study of surgical aortic stenosis characterized sex differences in left ventricular (LV) geometry and outcome. Materials and methods: We examined 92 women and 82 men who underwent echocardiography before valve replacement for aortic stenosis. Results: Women had a smaller cavity size (LV end-diastolic diameter 48.2 ± 7 mm in women vs 53.6 ± 7.6 mm in men; p = 0.0001) and higher ejection fraction (59% in women vs 54% in men; p = 0.02). LV mass was greater in men than women (300.4 ± 88 g in men vs 250.6 ± 85.8g in women; p = 0.0055) but when corrected for body surface area, the difference was not significant. The prevalence of LV hypertrophy was similar in both sexes (51% in women vs 49% in men; p = 0.62). The 5-year survival was 82% in women and 79% in men (p = 0.9). Conclusion: Several descriptors of LV geometry differed between men and women. These differences were largely eliminated after normalizing for body surface area. No differences in surgical mortality or long-term outcome were noted.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: Myocardial fibrosis in aortic stenosis (AS) may exhibit sex differences. However, its prognostic significance in women with AS remains  unclear. OBJECTIVE: To investigate sex differences in myocardial fibrosis  assessed by cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) and evaluate its prognostic  value in women and men with AS. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Patients with  severe AS who underwent CMR before aortic valve replacement (AVR) were  prospectively enrolled from 13 international sites between March 2011 and  September 2021. Myocardial fibrosis was evaluated using extracellular volume  fraction (ECV%) and late gadolinium enhancement (LGE). The main analysis was  conducted on patients without obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD), defined  as those with no history of myocardial infarction and no concomitant coronary  artery bypass grafting. Data were analyzed from December 2023 to February 2024.  EXPOSURES: Surgical or transcatheter AVR. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary  outcome was post-AVR all-cause mortality and the secondary outcome was  cardiovascular mortality. RESULTS: Of 822 patients, 670 were without obstructive  CAD (368 men [55%] and 302 women [45%]). Among these, women and men had a similar  age (median, 72 years vs 71 years, respectively), comorbidities, and AS severity.  ECV% was similar between sexes; however, women had less LGE (both infarct and  noninfarct LGE). After a median follow-up of 3.7 (IQR, 2.1-4.7) years, there were  76 deaths (11.3%), including 29 adjudicated cardiovascular deaths, in patients  without obstructive CAD. Increasing ECV% and LGE were associated with higher  all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in both sexes. Cox analyses demonstrated  that both ECV% and LGE were associated with higher all-cause mortality without  significant interaction by sex (women: adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.08 per 1%  ECV% increase; 95% CI, 1.04-1.12; P < .001; men: adjusted HR, 1.01; 95% CI,  0.96-1.06; P = .66; P for interaction by sex = .09 and women: adjusted HR, 2.49  for the presence of LGE; 95% CI, 1.07-5.80; P = .03; men: adjusted HR, 1.82; 95%  CI, 1.00-3.32; P = .04; P for interaction by sex = .68). In the entire population  (n = 822), both noninfarct and infarct-related LGE were associated with increased  mortality without significant interaction by sex. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In  this study, patients with severe AS who underwent AVR exhibited similar ECV%  between sexes, while women had lower LGE. Increased myocardial fibrosis provided  important prognostic value for both sexes.

AB  - Previous studies have demonstrated gender disparities in mortality and vascular complications after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) with early  generation transcatheter heart valves (THVs). It is unclear, however, whether  gender-related differences persist with the newer generation THVs. We aim to  assess gender disparities after TAVR with newer generation THVs. The MEDLINE and  Embase databases were thoroughly searched from inception to April 2023 to  identify studies that reported gender-specific outcomes after TAVR with newer  generation THVs (Sapien 3, Corevalve Evolut R, and Evolut Pro). The outcomes of  interest included 30-day mortality, 1-year mortality, and vascular complications.  In total, 5 studies (4 databases) with a total of 47,933 patients (21,073 females  and 26,860 males) were included. Ninety-six percent received TAVR via the  transfemoral approach. The females had higher 30-day mortality rates (odds ratio  (OR) = 1.53, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.31-1.79, p-value (p) < 0.001) and  vascular complications (OR = 1.43, 95% CI 1.23-1.65, p < 0.001). However,  one-year mortality was similar between the two groups (OR = 0.78, 95% CI  0.61-1.00, p = 0.28). The female gender continues to be associated with higher  30-day mortality rates and vascular complications after TAVR with newer  generation transcatheter heart valves, while there was no difference in 1-year  mortality between the genders. More data is needed to explore the causes and  whether we can improve TAVR outcomes in females.

AB  - Despite the advancement in medicine, there is still a lack of understanding of the sex disparities in disease onset, progression, treatment, and outcome. In  some life-threatening acute conditions, despite most patients with these  illnesses being males, females have a significantly higher chance of mortality.  This can be due to the differences in disease progression or healthcare  disparities in managing the illness between the sexes. Treatment of illnesses  tends to be more conservative for women without an explanation, but this  disparity is due to the healthcare provider. Infective endocarditis (IE) is an  acute life-threatening condition where bacteria latch onto and seed damaged  endocardium, with some preliminary information reporting differences between the  sexes. This paper aims to evaluate the sex disparities in the incidence, age,  comorbidities, etiology, risk factors, manifestations, treatment, and outcomes of  IE. From 2003-2023, 21584 articles were found that focused on the sex differences  in IE and, through PRISMA guidelines, were narrowed down to 34 publications.  There are significant differences between the sexes in IE, such as a  significantly higher incidence of IE in males, who also tend to be older and have  their native aortic valves involved, compared to younger females who have their  mitral valve involved. Comorbidities also vary between the sexes; females tend to  have atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease, psychiatric disorders, and  taking immunosuppressants compared to males who suffer from chronic liver  disease, underlying valve disease, and peripheral artery disease, contributing to  the ease of developing IE. While the most common microorganism leading to IE is  Staphylococcus aureus, females were more likely to have culture-negative IE, and  men were more likely to be infected with Streptococcus viridans. Major  manifestations in IE are fever and vegetation along the closure of the valves in  the heart, where females were more likely to have vegetation on the mitral and  aortic valves. At the same time, males were more likely to have it on the  tricuspid valve. On par with sex disparities in health, females usually took  longer to seek medical help than males despite the advancement of symptoms and  deterioration. Females were also treated conservatively through antibiotic  management, whereas males were more likely to advance to surgical treatment,  leading to a longer hospital stay. While there was no true difference in the  in-hospital mortality rate, the 30-day and 1-year mortality were significantly  increased in females. These differences provide a range of starting points for  various research to further educate physicians on sex disparities, such as why  males have a higher incidence of infective endocarditis and determining whether  it's hormones and basic metabolites, possibly limiting those who develop the  infection. Another important point is treating females with IE; the antibiotic  doses are standard, but whether they advance to surgical treatment is mostly up  to the provider. Some providers deny surgical treatment despite all indications,  but it could also be females denying surgery as they tend to leave against  medical advice. This review is crucial in developing the next steps to sex  disparity in IE, which may lead to better outcomes for males and females.

AB  - Whether sex differences exist in the cardiac remodeling related to aortic regurgitation (AR) is unclear. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) is the current  non-invasive reference standard for cardiac remodeling assessment and can  evaluate tissue characteristics. This prospective cohort included patients with  AR undergoing CMR between 2011 and 2020. We excluded patients with confounding  causes of remodeling. We quantified left ventricular (LV) volume, mass, AR  severity, replacement fibrosis by late Gadolinium enhancement (LGE), and  extracellular expansion by extracellular volume fraction (ECV). We studied 280  patients (109 women), median age 59.5 (47.2, 68.6) years (P for age = 0.25  between sexes). Women had smaller absolute LV volume and mass than men across the  spectrum of regurgitation volume (RVol) (P ≤ 0.01). In patients with ≥ moderate  AR and with adjustment for body surface area, indexed LV end-diastolic volume and  mass were not significantly different between sexes (all P > 0.5) but men had  larger indexed LV end systolic volume and lower LV ejection fraction (P ≥ 0.01).  Women were more likely to have NYHA class II or greater symptoms than men but  underwent surgery at a similar rate. Prevalence and extent of LGE was not  significantly different between sexes or across RVol. Increasing RVol was  independently associated with increasing ECV in women, but not in men (adjusted P  for interaction = 0.03). In conclusion, women had lower LV volumes and mass than  men across AR severity  but their ECV increased with higher regurgitant volume,  while ECV did not change in men. Indexing to body surface area did not fully  correct for the cardiac remodeling differences between men and women. Women were  more likely to have symptoms but underwent surgery at a similar rate to men.  Further research is needed to determine if differences in ECV would translate to  differences in the course of AR and outcomes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There is limited evidence on the effect of sex on permanent pacemaker implantation (PPMI) after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). The  primary objective of this meta-analysis was to determine the role of sex among  patients requiring PPMI post-TAVR. METHODS: A literature search was conducted  using the SCOPUS, MEDLINE, and CINAHL databases for studies published until  October 2022. Eligible studies included published randomized controlled trials  (RCTs) and Observational Cohort Studies (OCS) articles that reported PPMI as an  outcome of pacemaker status following TAVR. This study was performed per the  Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA)  Guidelines. Publication bias was estimated using a Funnel plot and Egger's test.  Data were pooled using a random-effects model. The primary endpoint was the sex  difference in PPMI after TAVR, with odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals  (CIs) extracted. RESULTS: Data was obtained from 63 studies, and a total of  79,655 patients were included. The cumulative PPMI rate was 15.5% (95% CI,  13.6%-17.7%). The pooled analysis revealed that while there were more females  than males undergoing TAVR (51.6%, 95% CI 50.4%-52.8%), males have a 14.5% higher  risk for post-TAVR PPMI than females (OR 1.145, 95% CI 1.047-1.253, P < 0.01).  CONCLUSIONS: Males are more likely to experience PPMI after TAVR than females.  Further research needs to be done to better explain these observed differences in  outcomes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Low stroke volume index <35 ml/m(2) despite preserved ejection fraction (paradoxical low flow [PLF]) is associated with adverse outcomes in  patients with aortic stenosis undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement  (TAVR) or surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR). However, whether the risk  associated with PLF is similar in both sexes is unknown. OBJECTIVES: The purpose  of this study was to analyze the risk associated with PLF in severe aortic  stenosis for men and women randomized to TAVR or SAVR. METHODS: Patients with  ejection fraction ≥50% from the PARTNER (Placement of Aortic Transcatheter  Valves) 2 and 3 trials were stratified by sex and treatment arm. The impact of  PLF on the 2-year occurrence of the composite of death or heart failure  hospitalization (primary endpoint) and of all-cause mortality alone (secondary  endpoint) was analyzed. Analysis of variance was used to assess baseline  differences between groups. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was used to  identify predictors of the endpoint. RESULTS: Out of 2,242 patients, PLF was  present in 390 men and 239 women (30% vs 26%, P = 0.06). PLF was associated with  a higher rate of NYHA functional class III to IV dyspnea (60% vs 54%, P < 0.001)  and a higher prevalence of atrial fibrillation (39% vs 24%, P < 0.001). PLF was a  significant predictor of the primary endpoint among women undergoing SAVR in  multivariate analysis (adjusted HR: 2.25 [95% CI: 1.14-4.43], P = 0.02) but was  not associated with a worse outcome in any of the other groups (all P > 0.05).  CONCLUSIONS: In women with PLF, TAVR may improve outcomes compared to SAVR. PLF  appears to have less impact on outcomes in men.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This review summarizes sex-based differences in aortic stenosis (AS) and identifies knowledge gaps that should be addressed by future studies.  BACKGROUND: AS is the most common valvular heart disease in developed countries.  Sex-specific differences have not been fully appreciated, as a result of  widespread under diagnosis of AS in women. SUMMARY: Studies including  sex-stratified analyses have shown differences in pathophysiology with less  calcification and more fibrosis in women's aortic valve. Women have impaired  myocardial perfusion reserve and different compensatory response of the left  ventricle (LV) to pressure overload, with concentric remodeling and more diffuse  fibrosis, in contrast to men with more focal fibrosis and more  dilated/eccentrically remodeled LV. There is sex difference in clinical  presentation and anatomical characteristics, with women having more paradoxical  low-flow/low-gradient AS, under-diagnosis and severity underestimated, with less  referral to aortic valve replacement (AVR) compared to men. The response to  therapies is also different: women have more adverse events with surgical AVR and  greater survival benefit with transcatheter AVR. After AVR, women would have more  favorable LV remodeling, but sex-related differences in changes in myocardial  reserve flow need future research. CONCLUSIONS: Investigation into these  described sex-related differences in AS offers potential utility for improving  prevention and treatment of AS in women and men. To better understand sex-based  differences in pathophysiology, clinical presentation, and response to therapies,  sex-specific critical knowledge gaps should be addressed in future research for  sex-specific personalized medicine.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine contemporary clinical differences between men and women with hemodynamically significant chronic aortic regurgitation (AR). PATIENTS AND  METHODS: We retrospectively identified 1072 consecutive patients with moderate to  severe or severe AR diagnosed between February 21, 2004, and April 29, 2019.  Echocardiographic data, aortic valve surgical intervention (AVS), and all-cause  death were analyzed. RESULTS: At baseline, the 189 women in the study group were  older than the 883 men (mean ± SD age, 64±18 years vs 58±17 years), had more  advanced symptoms, and had larger left ventricular end-systolic dimension index  (LVESDi) (all P<.001) despite similar AR severity. An LVESDi of greater than 20  mm/m(2) was noted in 60 of 92 asymptomatic women (65%) vs 225 of 559 asymptomatic  men (40%) (P<.001). Median follow-up was 5.6 years (interquartile range, 2.5 to  10.0 years). Female sex was associated with less AVS (P=.009), and overall  10-year survival was better in men (76%±2%) than in women (64%±5%) (P=.004).  However, 10-year post-AVS survival was similar between the sexes (P=.86), and  women had better left ventricular reverse remodeling than men regarding  end-diastolic dimension (P=.02). Multivariable independent predictors of death  were age, advanced symptoms, LVESDi, ejection fraction, and AVS (all P≤.03) but  not female sex. When compared with the age-matched US population, women exhibited  a 1.3-fold increased relative risk of death (P=.0383) while men had similar  survival (P=.11). CONCLUSION: In contemporary practice, women with AR continue to  exhibit an overall survival penalty not related to female sex but to late  referral markers, including more advanced symptoms, larger LVESDi, and less AVS.  Nonetheless, women in our study exhibited outstanding post-AVS left ventricular  remodeling and had good post-AVS survival, a step forward toward closing the  sex-related mortality gap. The high percentage of LVESDi of 20 mm/m(2) or greater  in asymptomatic women represents a window of opportunity for advanced-symptom  prevention and timely AR surgical correction that may close the mortality gap.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Sex-related differences play a pivotal role in disease manifestation and outcome in patients with cardiovascular disease, including aortic valve  stenosis (AS). However, data regarding sex-related hormonal differences in AS  patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is lacking.  OBJECTIVES: We aimed to assess sex-related hormonal variances in patients with  severe symptomatic AS and to evaluate the impact of these hormonal differences on  the clinical outcomes after TAVR. METHODS: In a total of 361 TAVR patients, we  assessed the hormonal status, including cortisol, parathormone (PTH),  insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAs),  estradiol, progesterone and testosterone prior to TAVR. We compared baseline  characteristics and outcome data according to sex and hormonal parameters. The  primary endpoint was 1-year all-cause mortality according to sex; secondary  endpoints included the risk of 1-year all-cause mortality in conjunction with  hormone levels, with pre-specified cut-off values. RESULTS: Rates of 1-year  all-cause mortality were comparable between the sexes (p = 0.285). Cox regression  analysis revealed significant associations between 1-year mortality and levels of  cortisol (HR 2.30; p = 0.007), PTH (HR 2.09; p = 0.019), DHEA-S (HR 0.47;  p = 0.016), and IGF-1 (HR 0.42; p = 0.004) in the overall cohort. Elevated  cortisol levels (p = 0.011), decreased DHEA-S levels (p = 0.007), and lower IGF-1  levels (p = 0.017) were significantly associated with higher rates of 1-year  all-cause mortality in males. Conversely, higher PTH levels were significantly  associated with an increased risk of 1-year mortality in females (p = 0.012).  CONCLUSION: Sex-specific hormonal differences significantly impact the prognosis  of severe AS patients undergoing TAVR. Elevated cortisol levels and decreased  DHEA-S and IGF-1 levels in males, as well as higher levels of PTH in females,  were associated with an increased mortality risk.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Little is known about the effect of sex on functional status decline in aortic valve stenosis (AS) patients. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was  to examine the changes in functional status according to sex in patients with  mild-to-moderate AS and its association with the composite of death or aortic  valve replacement (AVR). METHODS: We included patients with mild-to-moderate AS  prospectively recruited in the PROGRESSA (Metabolic Determinants of the  Progression of Aortic Stenosis) study (NCT01679431). Functional status was  assessed using the New York Heart Association classification and the Duke  Activity Status Index (DASI). RESULTS: A total of 244 patients (mean age  64 ± 14 years, 29% women) were included. The mean follow-up was 4.3 ± 2.4 years.  Women with intermediate-to-fast AS progression rate (median change in peak aortic  jet velocity ≥0.11 m/s/year) had significantly faster decline in DASI score  compared to men with similar progression rate (P < 0.05). In linear mixed  analysis adjusted for several clinical and echocardiographic factors, female sex  and change in peak aortic jet velocity remained strongly associated with the  worsening of New York Heart Association class and the decline of DASI score (all,  P < 0.001). The composite of death or AVR occurred in 115 patients (16 deaths and  99 AVRs). In multivariable Cox regression analyses, functional status decline  during follow-up remained significantly associated with the composite of death or  AVR (HR: 2.13; 95% CI: 1.22-3.73; P = 0.008). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with  mild-to-moderate AS at baseline, intermediate-to-fast progression rate of AS  was associated with a more rapid decline of functional status during follow-up,  particularly in women. Functional status decline during follow-up was strongly  associated with the incidence of death or AVR, with comparable effect in both  women and men.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Significant aortic regurgitation (AR) leads to left ventricular (LV) remodeling; however, little data exist regarding sex-based differences in LV  remodeling in this setting. We sought to compare LV remodeling and AR severity,  assessed by echocardiography and cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR), to  discern sex-based differences. METHODS: Patients with ≥ moderate chronic AR by  echocardiography who underwent CMR within 90 days between December 2005 and  October 2015 were included. Nonlinear regression models were built to assess the  effect of AR regurgitant fraction (RF) on LV remodeling. A generalized linear  model and Bland Altman analyses were constructed to evaluate differences between  CMR and echocardiography. Referral for surgical intervention based on symptoms  and LV remodeling was evaluated. RESULTS: Of the 243 patients (48.3 ± 16.6 years,  58 (24%) female), 119 (49%) underwent surgical intervention with a primary  indication of severe AR, 97 (82%) men, 22 (18%) women. Significant sex  differences in LV remodeling emerged on CMR. Women demonstrated significantly  smaller LV end-diastolic volume index (LVEDVI) (96.8 ml/m(2) vs 125.6 ml/m(2),  p < 0.001), LV end-systolic volume index (LVESVI) (41.1 vs 54.5 ml/m(2),  p < 0.001), blunted LV dilation in the setting of increasing AR severity (LVEDVI  p value < 0.001, LVESVI p value 0.011), and LV length indexed (8.32 vs 9.69 cm,  p < 0.001). On Bland Altman analysis, a significant interaction with sex and LV  diameters was evident, demonstrating a significant increase in the difference  between CMR and echocardiography measurements as the LV enlarged in women: LVEDVI  (p = 0.006), LVESVI (p < 0.001), such that echocardiographic measurements  increasingly underestimated LV diameters in women as the LV enlarged. LV length  was higher for males with a linear effect from RF (p < 0.001), with LV length  increasing at a higher rate with increasing RF for males compared to females  (two-way interaction with sex p = 0.005). Sphericity volume index was higher for  men after adjusting for a relative wall thickness (p = 0.033). CONCLUSIONS: CMR  assessment of chronic AR revealed significant sex differences in LV remodeling  and significant echocardiographic underestimation of LV dilation, particularly in  women. Defining optimal sex-based CMR thresholds for surgical referral should be  further developed. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NA.

AB  - Boys with congenital heart defects had essentially normal Verbal and Performnance IQ's on preoperative and postoperative tests; but girls' Verbal IQ's were  significantly lower than those of boys, and significantly lower than girls' own  Performance IQ's. This sex difference among congenital heart cases reverses the  usual finding that girls excel on Verbal tests.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Whether sex-related differences in the prognosis of infective endocarditis (IE) are due to differences in disease severity or comorbid  patterns, physiological specificities or a treatment indication bias is unclear.  We conducted an analysis of the pooled database of two population-based cohorts  of IE to reassess the relationships between sex, early valve surgery (EVS) and  outcome in patients with IE. METHODS: Demographic and baseline characteristics,  complications and outcome were compared in men and women with Duke-definite  left-sided IE. A propensity model for EVS was constructed using multivariate  logistic regression. Factors associated with 1-year mortality were identified  using multivariate Cox models adjusted for EVS factors. RESULTS: The study  population included 466 (75%) men and 154 (25%) women. Compared with men, women  were older (p=0.005), were more often on haemodialysis (p=0.04), more often had a  mitral valve IE (50.0% vs 35.8%, p=0.02), less often developed a septic shock  (p=0.05), less often underwent EVS (p=0.001) yet had comparable inhospital  mortality rates (20.1% vs 20.0%, p=0.96) and similar 1-year survival probability  (logrank p=0.68). Female sex was neither associated with EVS (OR 0.76 (95% CI  0.49 to 1.16)) nor mortality (HR 1.17 (95% CI 0.80 to 1.69)). However EVS was  associated with an increased risk of death in women in the early postoperative  period (HR 8.72 (95% CI 3.42 to 22.24), p=<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Women underwent  EVS less often than men. However female sex was independently associated with  neither EVS nor 1-year mortality. The reasons for a higher risk of early  postoperative mortality in women must still be elucidated.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To characterize gender differences in recovery of ventricular function and survival after aortic valve replacement (AVR), baseline  characteristics related to outcome were analyzed in 1012 consecutive patients  (329 women and 683 men) undergoing AVR in 1983 through 1990. METHODS AND RESULTS:  Seventy-seven percent of patients had aortic stenosis (AS), 11% insufficiency  (AI), and 12% mixed AS/AI; 42% underwent concomitant coronary artery bypass.  Women as a group had a greater mean age (P < .0001), had AS more frequently than  AI or AS/AI (P < .01), had coronary disease less frequently (P < .01), and had a  higher preoperative left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) (P < .0001), although  preoperative New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class was similar (P =  NS) compared with men. Male sex (P < .0001), advanced age (P < .0003), AI rather  than AS (P < .01), and greater extent of coronary disease (P < .04) were  independently associated with lower preoperative EF. Women with coronary disease  were as likely as men (P = NS) to undergo concomitant coronary bypass, and  completeness of revascularization did not differ (P = NS) by gender. Observed  survival probabilities after AVR (expressed as 30-day/5-year) were .97/.81  overall, .94/.77 for women, and .98/.83 for men (P < .02). Cox model analysis  showed advanced age, decreased preoperative EF, greater extent of coronary  disease, requirement for annular enlargement, smaller prosthetic valve size, and  advanced NYHA class (all P < .04) but neither female sex nor smaller body surface  area (both P = NS) as multivariate risk factors for overall mortality. In 664  patients (66%), postoperative EF was measured a mean 1.4 years after AVR. In  patients with preoperative EF < or = 45% (n = 167), the change in EF after AVR  was greater (P < .02) in women (from 33 +/- 8% to 48 +/- 15%, P < .001) than in  men (from 32 +/- 9% to 42 +/- 15%, P < .001). By multivariate regression  analysis, female sex (P < .02) and lesser extent of coronary disease (P < .05)  were independent predictors of early improvement in EF. Improvement in EF  conveyed an independent subsequent survival benefit to both women (P < .03) and  men (P < .001), and the magnitude of benefit did not differ (P = .4) between the  two groups. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that gender-related factors  importantly influence the adaptive and recovery response of the left ventricle to  pressure and volume overload. However, gender differences in LV adaptation do not  influence survival after AVR.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The association of epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) and coronary artery calcification (CAC) seems to differ by gender. However, few studies have  controlled for body size, and the ideal method for body size indexing has not  been explored. OBJECTIVES: To analyse the effect of gender related-body size  and-body fat differences on the association of EAT with CAC. METHODS: This was a  prospective cohort of 371 severe aortic stenosis patients (77±8.5year-old, 51%  females) referred to cardiac surgery. Agatston calcium score, EAT volume and  visceral abdominal fat (VAF) were obtained by computed tomography. Body  composition was determined using bioelectrical impedance analysis. Body weight  and height were measured to derive body mass index (BMI), body surface area  (BSA), and body surface index (BSI). EAT volume was normalized for BSA, weight  and height. RESULTS: Median CAC score was higher in men (887; IQR: 2010) than in  women (279: IQR: 145) (p<0.01). Similarly, men had higher volume of EAT than  women (137±65.6 vs. 106±65.6mL, p<0.01), even when BSA- or height-indexed, but  not if weight-indexed. EAT volume was associated with CAC adjusting for adiposity  (BMI or BSI and VAF, or fat mass), but not with further adjustment for gender. In  a stratified analysis, absolute- and indexed-volumes of EAT were independently  associated with CAC in men while no association was found in women  (gender-interaction p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In these high-risk patients, we  demonstrated that EAT was associated with CAC score irrespective of body size,  body fat and cardiovascular risk factors in men but not in women.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: In patients with severe aortic stenosis, we studied the impact of gender on preoperative left ventricular geometry and function, as well as on  early postoperative mortality and morbidity. METHODS: Prospective Doppler  echocardiographic evaluation was performed in 99 female patients and 96 males.  RESULTS: The patients had severe aortic stenosis and the mean pressure gradients  were similar in females and males. Left ventricular diastolic volume adjusted for  body surface area (BSA) was larger in males, 55+/-17.4 ml/m2 versus 43+/-13.1  mL/m2 (mean+/-standard deviation; P = 0.0001). The ejection fraction was similar  in females (55+/-14%) and males (55+/-13%), and patients of both sexes had  significantly lower stroke volume and cardiac index than healthy controls. The  relative wall thickness (wall thickness/diastolic diameter ratio) was higher (P =  0.03) in females (0.47+/-0.10) than in males (0.43+/-0.10) Consequently, the  diastolic diameter/wall thickness ratio (a substitute for wall tension) was  higher (P = 0.02) in males (4.2+/-0.99) than in females (3.9+/-0.80). Compared  with survivors, patients who died within 30 days of the operation (n = 17, 11  females) had a smaller body surface area (1.70+/-0.19 vs. 1.82+/-0.19 m2, P =  0.012), smaller left ventricular outflow tract (20.8+/-0.21 vs. 22.0+/-0.22 mm, P  = 0.023), higher incidence of abnormal intraventricular flow velocity (33 vs. 8%,  P = 0.018) and increased relative wall thickness (0.52+/-0.17 vs. 0.45+/-0.09 P =  0.039). Gender was of no independent importance for early mortality when age and  left ventricular outflow tract diameter were accounted for. CONCLUSIONS: Cardiac  adaptation to aortic stenosis seems to be influenced by gender, males presenting  larger left ventricular volumes and higher wall tension. The echocardiographic  findings of a narrow left ventricular outflow tract, abnormally increased  intraventricular velocity and increased relative wall thickness identified  patients with increased risk of early postoperative mortality. However gender had  no independent impact on early postoperative outcome.
